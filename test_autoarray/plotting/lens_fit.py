# In this tutorial, we'll introduce a new pixelization, called an adaptive-pixelization. This pixelization doesn't use
# uniform grid of rectangular pixels, but instead uses ir'Voronoi' pixels. So, why would we want to do that?
# Lets take another look at the rectangular grid, and think about its weakness.

# Lets quickly remind ourselves of the image, and the 3.0" circular mask we'll use to mask it.
