

- Think very carefully about how Preloads and w_tilde interface with database. Pickle array? Large filesize
but fast. Need to be careful with hyper galaxies.


__Refactor__

- Use composition in visualization MatPlot objects instead of inheritance.
- Extract geometry from mask package.
- auto_labels in visuals as a config loady thing.
- Split wrap / mat_wrap up into separate moduels.

__Visualization__

- Need to properly make it so one can disable many aspections of visualization.


__Inversion With Multiple Multiwavelength Datasets__

Can create a list of InversionMatrix objects for each dataset + tracer and then have a new class which takes a list of
these objects and creates a combined curvature_reg matrix from them, which solves for all datasets simultaneously.

This is genuine because it can reuse all existing functionality and doesn't require diting of the inner code
to get multi dataset fits working.

The regularization matrix could addition addition multi-data regularization terms added.

Multi analysis API can easily be used for model parameterization, with CombineAnalysis overwritten to define
the log likelihood fuinction (which maybe uses a special type of Fit object).



__Probably Terrible Idea Notes__

w_tilde_tlc:

 - Faster calculation of w_tilde_imaging (or quick way to get from old one?).

 - docstrings in Preloads for w_tilde.

 - Proper unit test on Preloads for w_tilde.

 - Add options for implciit preload of w_tilde / rest on and off, and manual input of snr_cut? Most likely make it so
