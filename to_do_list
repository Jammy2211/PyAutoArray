

- Think very carefully about how Preloads and w_tilde interface with database. Pickle array? Large filesize
but fast. Need to be careful with hyper galaxies.


__Refactor__

- Use composition in visualization MatPlot objects instead of inheritance.
- Extract geometry from mask package.
- auto_labels in visuals as a config loady thing.


__Visualization__

- Need to properly make it so one can disable many aspections of visualization.


__Probably Terrible Idea Notes__

w_tilde_tlc:

- Output snr_cut to hard disk for loading + reproducbility due to potential randomness of model.

- Setup rerpesentative tests on sLACS data reproducing errors on cosma. Include models but also use multiple
models, investigating change in model effects.

- w_tilde_via_snr_cut_iteration should compare to likelihood of fit without a snr_cut (in potential chi squared,
or disabled enitrely) as opposed to fit with nearby snr_cut. MAke sure this is the same comparison performed in check_preloads.

- The image we are using to set the curvature preload is not the lens subbed image, and therefore is not representative
of the data the inversion fits. Probably why the thing is so effing slow. Make chi squaed map or potrntial chi squared
map in Inversion module.

- USe potetial chi squared map due to negative image values (data is irellevent, due to lens light sub).

- Do not use w_tilde with an snr_cut when the lens light is being modeled, as this changes the
Inversion S/N image. Check by making sure the image of the inversion does not change between models. Maybe see if
there is a way this can be "ok".

 - Faster calculation of w_tilde_imaging (or quick way to get from old one?).

 - docstrings in Preloads for w_tilde.

 - Proper unit test on Preloads for w_tilde.

 - Add options for implciit preload of w_tilde / rest on and off, and manual input of snr_cut? Most likely make it so

 we assume snr_cut=0.0 but default with an optional flag for snr_cut_iterate

- For multiple mappers / fitting lens light with inversion we need to always fit the Inversion's profile subtracted
image or whatever is represnetative of what the data fits.
