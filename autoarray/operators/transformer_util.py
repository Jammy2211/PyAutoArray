    """
    Compute complex visibilities from an input sky image using the Fourier transform,
    simulating the response of an astronomical radio interferometer.

    This function converts an image defined on a sky coordinate grid into its
    visibility-space representation, given a set of (u,v) spatial frequency
    coordinates (in wavelengths), as sampled by a radio interferometer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_1d
        The 1D flattened sky brightness values corresponding to each pixel in the grid.
    grid_radians
        The angular (y, x) positions of each image pixel in radians, matching image_1d.
    uv_wavelengths
        The (u, v) spatial frequencies in units of wavelengths, for each baseline
        of the interferometer.

    Returns
    -------
    visibilities
        The complex visibilities (Fourier components) corresponding to each
        (u, v) coordinate, representing the interferometer’s measurement.
