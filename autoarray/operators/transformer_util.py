    """
    Sets up the real preloaded values used by the direct Fourier transform (`TransformerDFT`) to speed up
    the Fourier transform calculations.

    The preloaded values are the cosine terms of every (y,x) radian coordinate on the real-space grid multiplied by
    every `uv_wavelength` value.

    For large numbers of visibilities (> 100000) this array requires large amounts of memory (> 1 GB) and it is
    recommended this preloading is not used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid_radians
        The grid in radians corresponding to real-space mask within which the image that is Fourier transformed is
        computed.
    uv_wavelengths
        The wavelengths of the coordinates in the uv-plane for the interferometer dataset that is to be Fourier
        transformed.

    Returns
    -------
    The preloaded values of the cosine terms in the calculation of real entries of the direct Fourier transform.
