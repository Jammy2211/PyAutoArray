        """
         Over samples grid calculations using a uniform sub-grid.

        When a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates is input into a function, the result is evaluated at every coordinate
        on the grid. When the grid is paired to a 2D image (e.g. an `Array2D`) the solution needs to approximate
        the 2D integral of that function in each pixel. Over sample objects define how this over-sampling is performed.

        This object inputs a uniform sub-grid, where every image-pixel is split into a uniform grid of sub-pixels. The
        function is evaluated at every sub-pixel, and the final value in each pixel is computed by summing the
        contribution from all sub-pixels.

        This is the simplest over-sampling method, but may not provide precise solutions for functions that vary
        significantly within a pixel. To achieve precision in these pixels a high `sub_size` is required, which can
        be computationally expensive as it is applied to every pixel.

        **Example**

        If the mask's `sub_size` is > 1, the grid is defined as a sub-grid where each entry corresponds to the (y,x)
        coordinates at the centre of each sub-pixel of an unmasked pixel. The Grid2D is therefore stored as an ndarray
        of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates*sub_size**2, 2]

        The sub-grid indexes are ordered such that pixels begin from the first (top-left) sub-pixel in the first
        unmasked pixel. Indexes then go over the sub-pixels in each unmasked pixel, for every unmasked pixel.
        Therefore, the sub-grid is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates*(sub_grid_shape)**2, 2].

        For example:

        - grid[9, 1] - using a 2x2 sub-grid, gives the 3rd unmasked pixel's 2nd sub-pixel x-coordinate.
        - grid[9, 1] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 2nd unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel x-coordinate.
        - grid[27, 0] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 4th unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel y-coordinate.

        Below is a visual illustration of a sub grid. Indexing of each sub-pixel goes from the top-left corner. In
        contrast to the grid above, our illustration below restricts the mask to just 2 pixels, to keep the
        illustration brief.

        .. code-block:: bash

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from lens)
             x x x x O O x x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in lens)
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x

        Our grid with a sub-size looks like it did before:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pixel_scales = 1.0"

            <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

             x x x x x x x x x x  ^
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x  I                        y     x
             x x x x x x x x x x +ve  grid[0] = [0.5,  -1.5]
             x x x x 0 1 x x x x  y   grid[1] = [0.5,  -0.5]
             x x x x x x x x x x -ve
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x \/
             x x x x x x x x x x

        However, if the sub-size is 2, we go to each unmasked pixel and allocate sub-pixel coordinates for it. For
        example, for pixel 0, if *sub_size=2*, we use a 2x2 sub-grid:

        .. code-block:: bash

            Pixel 0 - (2x2):
                                y      x
                   grid[0] = [0.66, -1.66]
            I0I1I  grid[1] = [0.66, -1.33]
            I2I3I  grid[2] = [0.33, -1.66]
                   grid[3] = [0.33, -1.33]

        If we used a sub_size of 3, for the pixel we we would create a 3x3 sub-grid:

        .. code-block:: bash

                                  y      x
                     grid[0] = [0.75, -0.75]
                     grid[1] = [0.75, -0.5]
                     grid[2] = [0.75, -0.25]
            I0I1I2I  grid[3] = [0.5,  -0.75]
            I3I4I5I  grid[4] = [0.5,  -0.5]
            I6I7I8I  grid[5] = [0.5,  -0.25]
                     grid[6] = [0.25, -0.75]
                     grid[7] = [0.25, -0.5]
                     grid[8] = [0.25, -0.25]

        All sub-pixels in masked pixels have values (0.0, 0.0).

        __Adaptive Oversampling__

        By default, the sub-grid is the same size in every pixel (e.g. the value of `sub_size` is an integer that
        defines the size of the sub-grid for every pixel).

        However, the `sub_size` can also be input as an `Array2D`, with varying integer values for each pixel.
        This is called adaptive over-sampling and is used to adapt the over-sampling to the bright regions of the
        data, saving computational time.

        __Pixelization__

        For pixelizations performed in the inversion module, over sampling is equally important. Now, the over
        sampling maps multiple data sub-pixels to pixels in the pixelization, where mappings are performed fractionally
        based on the sub-grid sizes.

        The over sampling class has functions dedicated to mapping between the sub-grid and pixel-grid, for example
        `slim_for_sub_slim`.

         The class `OverSampling` is used for the high level API, whereby this is where users input their
         preferred over-sampling configuration. This class, `OverSampler`, contains the functionality
         which actually performs the over-sampling calculations, but is hidden from the user.

        Convenience method to access the binned-up array in its 1D representation, which is a Grid2D stored as an
        ``ndarray`` of shape [total_unmasked_pixels, 2].

        The binning up process converts a array from (y,x) values where each value is a coordinate on the sub-array to
        (y,x) values where each coordinate is at the centre of its mask (e.g. a array with a sub_size of 1). This is
        performed by taking the mean of all (y,x) values in each sub pixel.

        If the array is stored in 1D it is return as is. If it is stored in 2D, it must first be mapped from 2D to 1D.

        In **PyAutoCTI** all `Array2D` objects are used in their `native` representation without sub-gridding.
        Significant memory can be saved by only store this format, thus the `native_binned_only` config override
        can force this behaviour. It is recommended users do not use this option to avoid unexpected behaviour.

        Old docstring:

        scaled coordinates a the centre of every sub-pixel defined by this 2D mask array.

        The sub-grid is returned on an array of shape (total_unmasked_pixels*sub_size**2, 2). y coordinates are
        stored in the 0 index of the second dimension, x coordinates in the 1 index. Masked coordinates are therefore
        removed and not included in the slimmed grid.

        Grid2D are defined from the top-left corner, where the first unmasked sub-pixel corresponds to index 0.
