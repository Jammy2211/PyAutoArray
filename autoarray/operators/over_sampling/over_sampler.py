        """
         Over samples grid calculations using a uniform sub-grid.

        When a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates is input into a function, the result is evaluated at every coordinate
        on the grid. When the grid is paired to a 2D image (e.g. an `Array2D`) the solution needs to approximate
        the 2D integral of that function in each pixel. Over sample objects define how this over-sampling is performed.

        This object inputs a uniform sub-grid, where every image-pixel is split into a uniform grid of sub-pixels. The
        function is evaluated at every sub-pixel, and the final value in each pixel is computed by summing the
        contribution from all sub-pixels.

        This is the simplest over-sampling method, but may not provide precise solutions for functions that vary
        significantly within a pixel. To achieve precision in these pixels a high `sub_size` is required, which can
        be computationally expensive as it is applied to every pixel.

        **Example**

        If the mask's `sub_size` is > 1, the grid is defined as a sub-grid where each entry corresponds to the (y,x)
        coordinates at the centre of each sub-pixel of an unmasked pixel. The Grid2D is therefore stored as an ndarray
        of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates*sub_size**2, 2]

        The sub-grid indexes are ordered such that pixels begin from the first (top-left) sub-pixel in the first
        unmasked pixel. Indexes then go over the sub-pixels in each unmasked pixel, for every unmasked pixel.
        Therefore, the sub-grid is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates*(sub_grid_shape)**2, 2].

        For example:

        - grid[9, 1] - using a 2x2 sub-grid, gives the 3rd unmasked pixel's 2nd sub-pixel x-coordinate.
        - grid[9, 1] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 2nd unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel x-coordinate.
        - grid[27, 0] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 4th unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel y-coordinate.

        Below is a visual illustration of a sub grid. Indexing of each sub-pixel goes from the top-left corner. In
        contrast to the grid above, our illustration below restricts the mask to just 2 pixels, to keep the
        illustration brief.

        .. code-block:: bash

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from lens)
             x x x x O O x x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in lens)
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x

        Our grid with a sub-size looks like it did before:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pixel_scales = 1.0"

            <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

             x x x x x x x x x x  ^
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x  I                        y     x
             x x x x x x x x x x +ve  grid[0] = [0.5,  -1.5]
             x x x x 0 1 x x x x  y   grid[1] = [0.5,  -0.5]
             x x x x x x x x x x -ve
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x \/
             x x x x x x x x x x

        However, if the sub-size is 2, we go to each unmasked pixel and allocate sub-pixel coordinates for it. For
        example, for pixel 0, if *sub_size=2*, we use a 2x2 sub-grid:

        .. code-block:: bash

            Pixel 0 - (2x2):
                                y      x
                   grid[0] = [0.66, -1.66]
            I0I1I  grid[1] = [0.66, -1.33]
            I2I3I  grid[2] = [0.33, -1.66]
                   grid[3] = [0.33, -1.33]

        If we used a sub_size of 3, for the pixel we we would create a 3x3 sub-grid:

        .. code-block:: bash

                                  y      x
                     grid[0] = [0.75, -0.75]
                     grid[1] = [0.75, -0.5]
                     grid[2] = [0.75, -0.25]
            I0I1I2I  grid[3] = [0.5,  -0.75]
            I3I4I5I  grid[4] = [0.5,  -0.5]
            I6I7I8I  grid[5] = [0.5,  -0.25]
                     grid[6] = [0.25, -0.75]
                     grid[7] = [0.25, -0.5]
                     grid[8] = [0.25, -0.25]

        All sub-pixels in masked pixels have values (0.0, 0.0).

        __Adaptive Oversampling__

        By default, the sub-grid is the same size in every pixel (e.g. the value of `sub_size` is an integer that
        defines the size of the sub-grid for every pixel).

        However, the `sub_size` can also be input as an `Array2D`, with varying integer values for each pixel.
        This is called adaptive over-sampling and is used to adapt the over-sampling to the bright regions of the
        data, saving computational time.

        __Pixelization__

        For pixelizations performed in the inversion module, over sampling is equally important. Now, the over
        sampling maps multiple data sub-pixels to pixels in the pixelization, where mappings are performed fractionally
        based on the sub-grid sizes.

        The over sampling class has functions dedicated to mapping between the sub-grid and pixel-grid, for example
        `sub_mask_native_for_sub_mask_slim` and `slim_for_sub_slim`.

         The class `OverSampling` is used for the high level API, whereby this is where users input their
         preferred over-sampling configuration. This class, `OverSampler`, contains the functionality
         which actually performs the over-sampling calculations, but is hidden from the user.

        The binning up process converts a array from (y,x) values where each value is a coordinate on the sub-array to
