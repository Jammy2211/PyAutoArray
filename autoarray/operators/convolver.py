        """
        Compute and store the padded shapes and masks required for FFT-based convolution
        of masked 2D data with a kernel.

        FFT convolution operates on fully-sampled rectangular arrays, whereas scientific
        imaging data are typically defined only on a subset of pixels via a mask. This
        class determines how masked real-space data are embedded into a padded array,
        transformed to Fourier space, convolved with a kernel, and transformed back such
        that the result is equivalent to linear (not circular) convolution.

        The input mask defines which pixels contain valid data and therefore which
        regions of the image must be retained when mapping to and from FFT space. The
        kernel shape defines how far flux from unmasked pixels can spread into masked
        regions during convolution.

        This initializer inspects the mask and kernel to compute three key array shapes:

        ``mask_shape``
            The minimal rectangular bounding box enclosing all unmasked (False) pixels
            in the mask, expanded by half the kernel size in each direction. This is the
            smallest region that must be retained to ensure that convolution does not
            lose flux near the mask boundary.

        ``full_shape``
            The minimal array shape required for exact linear convolution, defined as::

                full_shape = mask_shape + kernel_shape - 1

            Padding to this size guarantees that FFT-based convolution is mathematically
            equivalent to direct spatial convolution, with no wrap-around artefacts.

        ``fft_shape``
            The FFT-efficient padded shape actually used for computation. Each dimension
            of ``full_shape`` is independently rounded up to the next fast length for
            real FFTs using ``scipy.fft.next_fast_len``. This shape defines the size of
            all arrays sent to and returned from FFT space.

            Note that even FFT sizes are currently incremented to odd sizes as a
            workaround for kernel-centering issues with even-sized kernels. This is an
            implementation detail and should be replaced by correct internal padding
            and centering logic.

        After determining ``fft_shape``, the input mask is padded accordingly and a
        *blurring mask* is derived. The blurring mask identifies pixels that are outside
        the original unmasked region but receive non-zero flux due to convolution with
        the kernel. These pixels must be retained when mapping results back to the
        masked domain to ensure correct convolution near mask boundaries.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kernel
            The 2D convolution kernel (e.g. a PSF). If a 1D kernel is provided, it is
            internally promoted to a minimal 2D kernel.
        mask
            A 2D boolean mask where False values indicate unmasked (valid) pixels and
            True values indicate masked pixels. The spatial extent of False pixels
            defines the region of the image that is embedded into FFT space.

        Attributes
        ----------
        fft_shape
            The FFT-friendly padded shape used for all Fourier transforms.
        mask
            The input mask padded to ``fft_shape``, with masked pixels set to True.
        blurring_mask
            A derived mask identifying pixels that are masked in the original input
            but receive flux due to convolution with the kernel.
        fft_kernel
            The real FFT of the padded kernel, used for efficient convolution in
            Fourier space.
        fft_kernel_mapping
            A broadcast-ready view of ``fft_kernel`` for multi-channel convolution.

        """
        A 2D convolution kernel paired with a mask, providing real-space and FFT-based
        convolution of images or mapping matrices.

        The ``Convolver`` is a subclass of ``Array2D`` with additional methods for
        performing point spread function (PSF) convolution. Each entry of the kernel
        corresponds to the PSF value at the centre of a pixel on a uniform 2D grid.

        Two convolution modes are supported:

        - **Real-space convolution**:
          Performed directly via sliding-window summation or
          ``jax.scipy.signal.convolve``. This mode is exact and requires no padding,
          but becomes computationally expensive for large kernels.

        - **FFT-based convolution**:
          Performed by embedding the input image and kernel into padded arrays,
          transforming them to Fourier space, multiplying, and transforming back.
          This mode is typically faster for kernels larger than approximately 5×5,
          but requires careful handling of padding, masking, and kernel centering.

        All logic related to FFT padding, mask expansion, linear (non-circular)
        convolution, and blurring-mask construction is handled by
        ``ConvolverState``. See the ``ConvolverState`` docstring for a detailed
        description of how masked real-space data are mapped to and from FFT space.

        When FFT convolution is enabled, the ``Convolver`` expects a corresponding
        ``ConvolverState`` defining the FFT geometry. The padded FFT shape is stored
        in ``state.fft_shape`` and must be consistent with the shape of any arrays
        passed for convolution. Attempting FFT convolution without a valid state
        will raise an exception to avoid silent shape or alignment errors.

        Parameters
        ----------
        kernel
            The raw 2D kernel values. These represent the PSF sampled at pixel
            centres and may be normalised to sum to unity if ``normalize=True``.
        state
            Optional ``ConvolverState`` instance defining FFT padding, mask
            expansion, and kernel Fourier transforms. Required when using FFT
            convolution.
        normalize
            If True, the kernel values are rescaled such that their sum is unity.
        use_fft
            If True, convolution is performed in Fourier space using the provided
            ``ConvolverState``.
            If False, convolution is performed in real space.
            If None, the default behaviour specified in the configuration is used.
        *args, **kwargs
            Passed to the ``Array2D`` constructor.

        Notes
        -----
        - When performing real-space convolution, the kernel must have odd dimensions
          in both axes so that it has a well-defined central pixel.
        - When performing FFT convolution, kernel centering, padding, and mask
          expansion are handled by ``ConvolverState``.
        - Blurring masks ensure that PSF flux spilling outside the main image mask
          is included correctly. Omitting them may lead to underestimated PSF wings.
        - For very small kernels, FFT and real-space convolution may differ slightly
          near mask boundaries due to padding and truncation effects.

        Padding ensures that the FFT implements *linear* convolution, not circular,
        and avoids wrap-around artefacts. The required padding is determined by
        ``fft_shape_from(mask)``. If no precomputed shapes exist, they are computed
        on the fly. For reproducible behaviour, precompute and set
        ``fft_shape` on the kernel.

        If ``use_fft=False``, convolution falls back to
        :meth:`Convolver.convolved_image_via_real_space_from`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image
            Masked 2D image array to convolve.
        blurring_image
            Masked image containing flux from outside the mask core that blurs
            into the masked region after convolution. If ``None``, only the direct
            image is convolved, which may be numerically incorrect if the mask
            excludes PSF wings.
        jax_method : {"direct", "fft"}
            Backend passed to ``jax.scipy.signal.convolve`` when in real-space mode.
            Ignored for FFT convolutions.

        Returns
        -------
        Array2D
            The convolved image in slim (1D masked) format.

        """
        Convolve a source-plane mapping matrix with this PSF.

        A mapping matrix maps image-plane unmasked pixels to source-plane pixels.
        This method performs the equivalent operation of PSF convolution on the
        mapping matrix, so that model visibilities / images can be computed via
        matrix multiplication instead of explicit convolution.

        If ``use_fft=True``, convolution is performed in Fourier space:
        - The mapping matrix is scattered into a 3D native cube
          (ny, nx, n_src).
        - An FFT of this cube is multiplied by the precomputed FFT of the PSF.
        - The inverse FFT is taken and cropped to the mask region.
        - The slim (masked 1D) representation is returned.

        If ``use_fft=False``, convolution falls back to
        :meth:`Convolver.convolved_mapping_matrix_via_real_space_from`.

        Notes
        -----
        - FFT convolution requires that ``self.fft_shape`` and related padding
          attributes are precomputed. If not, a ``ValueError`` is raised with the
          expected vs actual shapes. This ensures the mapping matrix is padded
          consistently with the PSF.
        - The optional ``blurring_mapping_matrix`` plays the same role as
          ``blurring_image`` in :meth:`convolved_image_from`, accounting for PSF flux
          that falls into the masked region from outside.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mapping_matrix : ndarray of shape (N_pix, N_src)
            Slim mapping matrix from unmasked pixels to source pixels.
        mask : Mask2D
            Associated mask defining the image grid.
        blurring_mapping_matrix : ndarray of shape (N_blur, N_src), optional
            Mapping matrix for the blurring region, outside the mask core.
        jax_method : str
            Backend passed to real-space convolution if ``use_fft=False``.
        use_mixed_precision
            If `True`, the FFT is performed using single precision, which provide significant speed up when using a
            GPU (x4), reduces VRAM use and is expected to have minimal impact on the accuracy of the results. If `False`,
            the FFT is performed using double precision, which is the default and is more accurate but slower on a GPU.

        Returns
        -------
        ndarray of shape (N_pix, N_src)
            Convolved mapping matrix in slim form.
