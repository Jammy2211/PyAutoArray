def transform(func):
    """
    Checks whether the input Grid2D of (y,x) coordinates have previously been transformed. If they have not
    been transformed then they are transformed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func
        A function where the input grid is the grid whose coordinates are transformed.

    Returns
    -------
        A function that can accept cartesian or transformed coordinates

        """
        This decorator checks whether the input grid has been transformed to the reference frame of the class
        that owns the function. If it has not been transformed, it is transformed.

        A function call which uses this decorator often has many subsequent function calls which also use the
        decorator. To ensure the grid is only transformed once, the `is_transformed` keyword is used to track
        whether the grid has been transformed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        obj
            An object whose function uses grid_like inputs to compute quantities at every coordinate on the grid.
        grid
            The (y, x) coordinates in the original reference frame of the grid.

        Returns
        -------
            A grid_like object whose coordinates may be transformed.
