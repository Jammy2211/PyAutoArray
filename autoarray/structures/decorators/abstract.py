class AbstractMaker:

        """
        Makes 2D data structures from an input function and grid, ensuring that the structure of the input grid is
        paired to the structure of the output data structure.

        This is used by the `to_array`, `to_grid` and `to_vector_yx` decorators to ensure that the input grid and output
        data structure are consistent.

        There are two types of consistent data structures and therefore decorated function mappings:

        - Uniform: 2D structures defined on a uniform grid of data points, for example the `Array2D` and `Grid2D`
        objects. Both structures are defined according to a `Mask2D`, which the maker object ensures is passed through
        self consistently.

        - Irregular: 2D structures defined on an irregular grid of data points, for example an `ArrayIrregular`
        and `Grid2DIrregular` objects. Neither structure is defined according to a mask and the maker ensures the lack of
        a mask does not prevent the function from being evaluated.

        Parameters
        ----------
        func
            The function that is being decorated, which the maker object evaluates to create the output data structure.
        obj
            The object that the function is a method of, which is passed to the function when it is evaluated. This
            is typically the self object of the class the function is a method of.
        grid
            The grid that is passed to the function when it is evaluated, which is used to evaluate the function.
            For example, this might be the `Grid2D` object that the function checks the typing of when determining
            the output data structure.
        args
            Any arguments that are passed to the function when it is evaluated.
        kwargs
            Any keyword arguments that are passed to the function when it is evaluated.

        The result of the function that is being decorated, which this function converts to the output data structure

        This function calls one of two methods, depending on the type of the input grid:

        - `via_grid_2d`: If the input grid is a `Grid2D` object.
        - `via_grid_2d_irr`: If the input grid is a `Grid2DIrregular` object.
