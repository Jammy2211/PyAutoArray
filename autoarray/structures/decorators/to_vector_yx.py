        """
        This decorator homogenizes the input of a "grid_like" 2D structure (`Grid2D`, `Grid2DIrregular` or `Grid1D`)
        into a function which outputs a vector-like structure (`VectorYX2D` or `VectorYX2DIrregular`).

        It allows these classes to be interchangeably input into a function, such that the grid is used to evaluate
        the function at every (y,x) coordinates of the grid using specific functionality of the input grid.

        The grid_like objects `Grid2D` and `Grid2DIrregular` are input into the function as a slimmed 2D ndarray array
        of shape [total_coordinates, 2] where the second dimension stores the (y,x)

        There are three types of consistent data structures and therefore decorated function mappings:

        - Uniform (`Grid2D` -> `VectorYX2D`): 2D structures defined on a uniform grid of data points. Both structures are
        defined according to a `Mask2D`, which the maker object ensures is passed through self consistently.

        - Irregular (`Grid2DIrregular` -> `VectorYX2DIrregular`: 2D structures defined on an irregular grid of data points,
        Neither structure is defined according to a mask and the maker sures the lack of a mask does not prevent the
        function from being evaluated.

        - 1D (`Grid1D` -> `Grid2D`): 1D structures defined on a 1D grid of data points. These are not applicable
        for vector-like structures and are not supported by this decorator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        obj
            An object whose function uses grid_like inputs to compute quantities at every coordinate on the grid.
        grid
            A grid_like object of coordinates on which the function values are evaluated.

        Returns
        -------
            The function values evaluated on the grid with the same structure as the input grid_like object.
