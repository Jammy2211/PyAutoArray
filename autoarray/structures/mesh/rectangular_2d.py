        """
        A grid of (y,x) coordinates which represent a uniform rectangular pixelization.

        A `Mesh2DRectangular` is ordered such pixels begin from the top-row and go rightwards and then downwards.
        It is an ndarray of shape [total_pixels, 2], where the first dimension of the ndarray corresponds to the
        pixelization's pixel index and second element whether it is a y or x arc-second coordinate.

        For example:

        - grid[3,0] = the y-coordinate of the 4th pixel in the rectangular pixelization.
        - grid[6,1] = the x-coordinate of the 7th pixel in the rectangular pixelization.

        This class is used in conjuction with the `inversion/pixelizations` package to create rectangular pixelizations
        and mappers that perform an `Inversion`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The grid of (y,x) coordinates corresponding to the centres of each pixel in the rectangular pixelization.
        shape_native
            The 2D dimensions of the rectangular pixelization with shape (y_pixels, x_pixel).
        pixel_scales
            The (y,x) scaled units to pixel units conversion factors of every pixel. If this is input as a `float`,
            it is converted to a (float, float) structure.
        origin
            The (y,x) origin of the pixelization.

        Creates a `Grid2DRecntagular` by overlaying the rectangular pixelization over an input grid of (y,x)
        coordinates.

        This is performed by first computing the minimum and maximum y and x coordinates of the input grid. A
        rectangular pixelization with dimensions `shape_native` is then laid over the grid using these coordinates,
        such that the extreme edges of this rectangular pixelization overlap these maximum and minimum (y,x) coordinates.

        A a `buffer` can be included which increases the size of the rectangular pixelization, placing additional
        spacing beyond these maximum and minimum coordinates.

        """
        The reconstruction of data certain pixelizations, for example a `Delaunay` triangulation, requires that
        reconstructed data (e.g. the `reconstruction` output from an `Inversion`) is on an irregular pixelization.

        Analysing the reconstruction can therefore be difficult and require specific functionality tailored to the
        `Delaunay` triangulation.

        This function therefore interpolates the reconstruction on to a regular grid of square pixels.
        For a rectangular pixelization which is uniform, this is not stricly necessary as the native grid is
        easy to analyse. This interpolation function is included partly to mirror the API of other pixelizations.

        The output interpolated reconstruction cis by default returned on a grid of 401 x 401 square pixels. This
        can be customized by changing the `shape_native` input, and a rectangular grid with rectangular pixels can
        be returned by instead inputting the optional `shape_scaled` tuple.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The value corresponding to the reconstructed value of every rectangular pixel on the rectangular grid.
        shape_native
            The 2D shape in pixels of the interpolated reconstruction, which is always returned using square pixels.
        extent
            The (x0, x1, y0, y1) extent of the grid in scaled coordinates over which the grid is created if it
            is input.
