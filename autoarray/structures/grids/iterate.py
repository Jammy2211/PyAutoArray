        """Represents a grid of coordinates as described for the *Grid* class, but using an iterative sub-grid that
        adapts its resolution when it is input into a function that performs an analytic calculation.

        A *Grid* represents (y,x) coordinates using a sub-grid, where functions are evaluated once at every coordinate
        on the sub-grid and averaged to give a more precise evaluation an analytic function. A *GridIterate* does not
        have a specified sub-grid size, but instead iteratively recomputes the analytic function at increasing sub-grid
        sizes until an input fractional accuracy is reached.

        Iteration is performed on a per (y,x) coordinate basis, such that the sub-grid size will adopt low values
        wherever doing so can meet the fractional accuracy and high values only where it is required to meet the
        fractional accuracy. For functions where a wide range of sub-grid sizes allow fractional accuracy to be met
        this ensures the function can be evaluated accurate in a computaionally efficient manner.

        This overcomes a limitation of the *Grid* class whereby if a small subset of pixels require high levels of
        sub-gridding to be evaluated accuracy, the entire grid would require this sub-grid size thus leading to
        unecessary expensive function evaluations.

        fractional_accuracy : float
