    """
    The function `grid_scaled_2d_slim_radial_projected_from()` determines a projected radial grid of points from a 2D
    region of coordinates defined by an extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and with a (y,x) centre.

    To do this, the function first performs these 3 steps:

    1) Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance of
    the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region (e.g. following the positive / negative y and x axes).

    2) Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen (e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
    pixel_scale in the x dimension is used).

    3) Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between the
    two chosen above.

    A schematic is shown below:

    -------------------
    |                 |
    |<- - -  - ->x    | x = centre
    |                 | <-> = longest radial path from centre to extent edge
    |                 |
    -------------------

    Using the centre x above, this function finds the longest radial path to the edge of the extent window.

    This function returns the integer number of pixels given by this radial grid, which is then used to create
    the radial grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    extent
        The extent of the grid the radii grid is computed using, with format [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]
    centre : (float, flloat)
        The (y,x) central coordinate which the radial grid is traced outwards from.
    pixel_scales
        The (y,x) scaled units to pixel units conversion factor of the 2D mask array.
    sub_size
        The size of the sub-grid that each pixel of the 2D mask array is divided into.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The 1D integer shape of a radial set of points sampling the longest distance from the centre to the edge of the
        extent in along the positive x-axis.

    """
    Determine a projected radial grid of points from a 2D region of coordinates defined by an
    extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and with a (y,x) centre.

    This functions operates as follows:

    1) Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance of
    the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region (e.g. following the positive / negative y and x axes).

    2) Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen (e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
    pixel_scale in the x dimension is used).

    3) Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between the
    two chosen above.

    4) Create a (y,x) grid of radial points where all points are at the centre's y value = 0.0 and the x values iterate
    from the centre in increasing steps of the pixel-scale.

    5) Rotate these radial coordinates by the input `angle` clockwise.

    A schematric is shown below:

    -------------------
    |                 |
    |<- - -  - ->x    | x = centre
    |                 | <-> = longest radial path from centre to extent edge
    |                 |
    -------------------

    Using the centre x above, this function finds the longest radial path to the edge of the extent window.

    The returned `grid_radii` represents a radial set of points that in 1D sample the 2D grid outwards from its centre.
    This grid stores the radial coordinates as (y,x) values (where all y values are the same) as opposed to a 1D data
    structure so that it can be used in functions which require that a 2D grid structure is input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    extent
        The extent of the grid the radii grid is computed using, with format [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]
    centre : (float, flloat)
        The (y,x) central coordinate which the radial grid is traced outwards from.
    pixel_scales
        The (y,x) scaled units to pixel units conversion factor of the 2D mask array.
    sub_size
        The size of the sub-grid that each pixel of the 2D mask array is divided into.
    shape_slim
        Manually choose the shape of the 1D projected grid that is returned. If 0, the border based on the 2D grid is
        used (due to numba None cannot be used as a default value).

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        A radial set of points sampling the longest distance from the centre to the edge of the extent in along the
        positive x-axis.

def relocated_grid_via_jit_from(grid, border_grid):
    """
    Relocate the coordinates of a grid to its border if they are outside the border, where the border is
    defined as all pixels at the edge of the grid's mask (see *mask._border_1d_indexes*).

    This is performed as follows:

    1: Use the mean value of the grid's y and x coordinates to determine the origin of the grid.
    2: Compute the radial distance of every grid coordinate from the origin.
    3: For every coordinate, find its nearest pixel in the border.
    4: Determine if it is outside the border, by comparing its radial distance from the origin to its paired
    border pixel's radial distance.
    5: If its radial distance is larger, use the ratio of radial distances to move the coordinate to the
    border (if its inside the border, do nothing).

    The method can be used on uniform or irregular grids, however for irregular grids the border of the
    'image-plane' mask is used to define border pixels.

    Parameters
    ----------

        The grid (uniform or irregular) whose pixels are to be relocated to the border edge if outside it.
