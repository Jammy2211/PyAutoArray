    The function `grid_scaled_2d_slim_radial_projected_from()` determines a projected radial grid of points from a 2D
    region of coordinates defined by an extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and with a (y,x) centre.

    To do this, the function first performs these 3 steps:

    1) Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance of
    the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region (e.g. following the positive / negative y and x axes).

    2) Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen (e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
    pixel_scale in the x dimension is used).

    3) Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between the
    two chosen above.

    -------------------

    Using the centre x above, this function finds the longest radial path to the edge of the extent window.

    This function returns the integer number of pixels given by this radial grid, which is then used to create
    the radial grid.

    """
    Determine a projected radial grid of points from a 2D region of coordinates defined by an
    extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and with a (y,x) centre.

    This functions operates as follows:

    1) Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance of
    the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region (e.g. following the positive / negative y and x axes).

    2) Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen (e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
    pixel_scale in the x dimension is used).

    3) Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between the
    two chosen above.

    4) Create a (y,x) grid of radial points where all points are at the centre's y value = 0.0 and the x values iterate
    from the centre in increasing steps of the pixel-scale.

    5) Rotate these radial coordinates by the input `angle` clockwise.

    A schematric is shown below:

    -------------------
    |                 |

    |                 |
    -------------------

    Using the centre x above, this function finds the longest radial path to the edge of the extent window.

    The returned `grid_radii` represents a radial set of points that in 1D sample the 2D grid outwards from its centre.
    This grid stores the radial coordinates as (y,x) values (where all y values are the same) as opposed to a 1D data
    structure so that it can be used in functions which require that a 2D grid structure is input.

    centre : (float, flloat)

    pixel_scales
        The (y,x) scaled units to pixel units conversion factor of the 2D mask array.
    shape_slim
        Manually choose the shape of the 1D projected grid that is returned. If 0, the border based on the 2D grid is

    The pixel coordinate origin is at the top left corner of the native grid and goes right-wards and downwards, such
    that for an grid of shape (3,3) where all pixels are unmasked:

    - pixel [0,0] of the 2D grid will correspond to index 0 of the 1D grid.
    - pixel [0,1] of the 2D grid will correspond to index 1 of the 1D grid.

    ----------

        The native grid of (y,x) values which are mapped to the slimmed grid.
    mask_2d
