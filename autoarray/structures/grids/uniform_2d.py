        """
        A grid of 2D (y,x) coordinates, which are paired to a uniform 2D mask of pixels. Each entry
        on the grid corresponds to the (y,x) coordinates at the centre of a pixel of an unmasked pixel.

        A `Grid2D` is ordered such that pixels begin from the top-row (e.g. index [0, 0]) of the corresponding mask
        and go right and down. The positive y-axis is upwards and positive x-axis to the right.

        The grid can be stored in two formats:

        - slimmed: all masked entries are removed so the ndarray is shape [total_unmasked_coordinates**2, 2]
        - native: it retains the original shape of the grid so the ndarray is
          shape [total_y_coordinates, total_x_coordinates, 2].


        __Slim__

        The Grid2D is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates, 2], therefore when `slim` the shape of
        the grid is 2, not 1.

        The first element of the ndarray corresponds to the pixel index and second element the y or x coordinate value.

        For example:

        - grid[3,0] = the 4th unmasked pixel's y-coordinate.
        - grid[6,1] = the 7th unmasked pixel's x-coordinate.

        Below is a visual illustration of a grid, where a total of 10 pixels are unmasked and are included in \
        the grid.

        .. code-block:: bash

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the grid)
             x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the grid)

             x x x x x x x x x x      grid[9] = [-0.5,  1.5]

        __native__

        The Grid2D has the same properties as Case 1, but is stored as an an ndarray of shape
        [total_y_coordinates, total_x_coordinates, 2]. Therefore when `native` the shape of the
        grid is 3, not 2.

        All masked entries on the grid has (y,x) values of (0.0, 0.0).

        For the following example mask:

        .. code-block:: bash

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the grid)
             x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the grid)
             x x x O O O O x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x

        In the above grid:

            - grid[0,0,0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[0,0,1] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[3,3,0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[3,3,1] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[3,4,0] = 1.5
            - grid[3,4,1] = -0.5

        **Grid2D Mapping:**

        Every set of (y,x) coordinates in a pixel of the grid maps to an unmasked pixel in the mask. For a uniform
        grid, every (y,x) coordinate directly corresponds to the location of its paired unmasked pixel.

        It is not a requirement that grid is uniform and that their coordinates align with the mask. The input grid
        could be an irregular set of (y,x) coordinates where the indexing signifies that the (y,x) coordinate
        *originates* or *is paired with* the mask's pixels but has had its value change by some aspect of the
        calculation.

        This is important for the child project *PyAutoLens*, where grids in the image-plane are ray-traced and
        deflected to perform lensing calculations. The grid indexing is used to map pixels between the image-plane and
        source-plane.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The (y,x) coordinates of the grid.
        mask
            The 2D mask associated with the grid, defining the pixels each grid coordinate is paired with and
            originates from.
        store_native
            If True, the ndarray is stored in its native format [total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels, 2]. This avoids
            mapping large data arrays to and from the slim / native formats, which can be a computational bottleneck.
        over_sample_size
            The over sampling scheme size, which divides the grid into a sub grid of smaller pixels when computing
            values (e.g. images) from the grid to approximate the 2D line integral of the amount of light that falls
            into each pixel.
        over_sampled
            The over sampled grid of (y,x) coordinates, which can be passed in manually because if the grid is
            not uniform (e.g. due to gravitational lensing) is cannot be computed internally in this function. If the
            over sampled grid is not passed in it is computed assuming uniformity.

        The function `grid_scaled_2d_slim_radial_projected_from()` determines a projected radial grid of points from a
        2D region of coordinates defined by an extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and with a (y,x) centre.

        To do this, the function first performs these 3 steps:

        1) Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance
           of the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region (e.g. following the positive / negative y and
           x axes).

        2) Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen (e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
           pixel_scale in the x dimension is used).

        3) Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between
           the two chosen above.

        A schematic is shown below:

        .. code-block:: bash

            -------------------
            |                 |
            |<- - -  - ->x    | x = centre
            |                 | <-> = longest radial path from centre to extent edge
            |                 |
            -------------------

        Using the centre x above, this function finds the longest radial path to the edge of the extent window.

        This function returns the integer number of pixels given by this radial grid, which is then used to create
        the radial grid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        extent
            The extent of the grid the radii grid is computed using, with format [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]

        Determine a projected radial grid of points from a 2D region of coordinates defined by an
        extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and with a (y,x) centre.

        This functions operates as follows:

        1) Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance
           of the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region e.g. following the positive / negative y and
           x axes.

        2) Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
           pixel_scale in the x dimension is used.

        3) Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between
           the two chosen above.

        4) Create a (y,x) grid of radial points where all points are at the centre's y value = 0.0 and the x values
           iterate from the centre in increasing steps of the pixel-scale.

        5) Rotate these radial coordinates by the input `angle` clockwise.
