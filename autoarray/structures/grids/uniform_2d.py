        """
        A grid of 2D (y,x) coordinates, which are paired to a uniform 2D mask of pixels and sub-pixels. Each entry
        on the grid corresponds to the (y,x) coordinates at the centre of a sub-pixel of an unmasked pixel.

        A `Grid2D` is ordered such that pixels begin from the top-row (e.g. index [0, 0]) of the corresponding mask
        and go right and down. The positive y-axis is upwards and positive x-axis to the right.

        The grid can be stored in two formats:

        - slimmed: all masked entries are removed so the ndarray is shape [total_unmasked_coordinates*sub_size**2, 2]
        - native: it retains the original shape of the grid so the ndarray is
          shape [total_y_coordinates*sub_size, total_x_coordinates*sub_size, 2].


        **Case 1 (sub-size=1, slim)**

        The Grid2D is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates, 2], therefore when `slim` the shape of
        the grid is 2, not 1.

        The first element of the ndarray corresponds to the pixel index and second element the y or x coordinate value.

        For example:

        - grid[3,0] = the 4th unmasked pixel's y-coordinate.
        - grid[6,1] = the 7th unmasked pixel's x-coordinate.

        Below is a visual illustration of a grid, where a total of 10 pixels are unmasked and are included in \
        the grid.

        .. code-block:: bash

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the grid)
             x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the grid)

             x x x x x x x x x x      grid[9] = [-0.5,  1.5]


        **Case 2 (sub-size>1, slim)**

        If the mask's `sub_size` is > 1, the grid is defined as a sub-grid where each entry corresponds to the (y,x)
        coordinates at the centre of each sub-pixel of an unmasked pixel. The Grid2D is therefore stored as an ndarray
        of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates*sub_size**2, 2]

        The sub-grid indexes are ordered such that pixels begin from the first (top-left) sub-pixel in the first
        unmasked pixel. Indexes then go over the sub-pixels in each unmasked pixel, for every unmasked pixel.
        Therefore, the sub-grid is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates*(sub_grid_shape)**2, 2].

        For example:

        - grid[9, 1] - using a 2x2 sub-grid, gives the 3rd unmasked pixel's 2nd sub-pixel x-coordinate.
        - grid[9, 1] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 2nd unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel x-coordinate.
        - grid[27, 0] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 4th unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel y-coordinate.

        Below is a visual illustration of a sub grid. Indexing of each sub-pixel goes from the top-left corner. In
        contrast to the grid above, our illustration below restricts the mask to just 2 pixels, to keep the
        illustration brief.

        .. code-block:: bash

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from lens)
             x x x x O O x x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in lens)
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x

        Our grid with a sub-size looks like it did before:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pixel_scales = 1.0"

            <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

             x x x x x x x x x x  ^
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x  I                        y     x
             x x x x x x x x x x +ve  grid[0] = [0.5,  -1.5]
             x x x x 0 1 x x x x  y   grid[1] = [0.5,  -0.5]
             x x x x x x x x x x -ve
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x  I
             x x x x x x x x x x \/
             x x x x x x x x x x

        However, if the sub-size is 2, we go to each unmasked pixel and allocate sub-pixel coordinates for it. For
        example, for pixel 0, if *sub_size=2*, we use a 2x2 sub-grid:

        .. code-block:: bash

            Pixel 0 - (2x2):
                                y      x
                   grid[0] = [0.66, -1.66]
            I0I1I  grid[1] = [0.66, -1.33]
            I2I3I  grid[2] = [0.33, -1.66]
                   grid[3] = [0.33, -1.33]

        If we used a sub_size of 3, for the pixel we we would create a 3x3 sub-grid:

        .. code-block:: bash

                                  y      x
                     grid[0] = [0.75, -0.75]
                     grid[1] = [0.75, -0.5]
                     grid[2] = [0.75, -0.25]
            I0I1I2I  grid[3] = [0.5,  -0.75]
            I3I4I5I  grid[4] = [0.5,  -0.5]
            I6I7I8I  grid[5] = [0.5,  -0.25]
                     grid[6] = [0.25, -0.75]
                     grid[7] = [0.25, -0.5]
                     grid[8] = [0.25, -0.25]


        **Case 3 (sub_size=1, native)**

        The Grid2D has the same properties as Case 1, but is stored as an an ndarray of shape
        [total_y_coordinates, total_x_coordinates, 2]. Therefore when `native` the shape of the
        grid is 3, not 2.

        All masked entries on the grid has (y,x) values of (0.0, 0.0).

        For the following example mask:

        .. code-block:: bash

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the grid)
             x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the grid)
             x x x O O O O x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x

        In the above grid:

            - grid[0,0,0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[0,0,1] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[3,3,0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[3,3,1] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[3,4,0] = 1.5
            - grid[3,4,1] = -0.5


        **Case 4 (sub_size>1 native)**

        The properties of this grid can be derived by combining Case's 2 and 3 above, whereby the grid is stored as
        an ndarray of shape [total_y_coordinates*sub_size, total_x_coordinates*sub_size, 2].

        All sub-pixels in masked pixels have values (0.0, 0.0).


        **Grid2D Mapping:**

        Every set of (y,x) coordinates in a pixel of the sub-grid maps to an unmasked pixel in the mask. For a uniform
        grid, every (y,x) coordinate directly corresponds to the location of its paired unmasked pixel.

        It is not a requirement that grid is uniform and that their coordinates align with the mask. The input grid
        could be an irregular set of (y,x) coordinates where the indexing signifies that the (y,x) coordinate
        *originates* or *is paired with* the mask's pixels but has had its value change by some aspect of the
        calculation.

        This is important for the child project *PyAutoLens*, where grids in the image-plane are ray-traced and
        deflected to perform lensing calculations. The grid indexing is used to map pixels between the image-plane and
        source-plane.

        store_native
            If True, the ndarray is stored in its native format [total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels, 2]. This avoids
            mapping large data arrays to and from the slim / native formats, which can be a computational bottleneck.

        The function `grid_scaled_2d_slim_radial_projected_from()` determines a projected radial grid of points from a
        2D region of coordinates defined by an extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and with a (y,x) centre.

        To do this, the function first performs these 3 steps:

        1) Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance
           of the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region (e.g. following the positive / negative y and
           x axes).

        2) Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen (e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
           pixel_scale in the x dimension is used).

        3) Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between
           the two chosen above.

        A schematic is shown below:

        .. code-block:: bash

            -------------------
            |                 |

            |                 | <-> = longest radial path from centre to extent edge
            |                 |
            -------------------

        Using the centre x above, this function finds the longest radial path to the edge of the extent window.

        This function returns the integer number of pixels given by this radial grid, which is then used to create
        the radial grid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        extent
            The extent of the grid the radii grid is computed using, with format [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]
        centre : (float, flloat)

        sub_size
            The size of the sub-grid that each pixel of the 2D mask array is divided into.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            The 1D integer shape of a radial set of points sampling the longest distance from the centre to the edge of the
