) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    The `manual` classmethods in the Grid2D object take as input a list or ndarray which is returned as a Grid2D.

    This function performs the following and checks and conversions on the input:

    1: If the input is a list, convert it to an ndarray.
    2: Check that the number of pixels in the array is identical to that of the mask.
    3) Map the input ndarray to its `slim` representation.

    For a Grid2D, `slim` refers to a 2D NumPy array of shape [total_coordinates, 2] and `native` a 3D NumPy array of
    shape [total_y_coordinates, total_x_coordinates, 2]

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid_2d
        The input (y,x) grid of coordinates which is converted to an ndarray if it is a list.
    mask_2d
        The mask of the output Array2D.
    store_native
        If True, the ndarray is stored in its native format [total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels, 2]. This avoids
        mapping large data arrays to and from the slim / native formats, which can be a computational bottleneck.

    grid where masked values are set to zero.

    This uses a 1D array 'slim_to_native' where each index gives the 1D pixel indexes of the grid's native unmasked
    pixels, for example:

    - If slim_to_native[0] = [0], the first value of the 1D slimmed grid maps to the pixel [0] of the native 1D grid.
    - If slim_to_native[1] = [2], the second value of the 1D slimmed grid maps to the pixel [2] of the native 1D grid.
    - If slim_to_native[4] = [9], the fifth value of the 1D slimmed grid maps to the pixels [9] of the native 1D grid.
