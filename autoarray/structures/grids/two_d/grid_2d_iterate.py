        """
        Represents a grid of coordinates as described for the `Grid2D` class, but using an iterative sub-grid that
        adapts its resolution when it is input into a function that performs an analytic calculation.

        A `Grid2D` represents (y,x) coordinates using a sub-grid, where functions are evaluated once at every coordinate
        on the sub-grid and averaged to give a more precise evaluation an analytic function. A `Grid2DIterate` does not
        have a specified sub-grid size, but instead iteratively recomputes the analytic function at increasing sub-grid
        sizes until an input fractional accuracy is reached.

        Iteration is performed on a per (y,x) coordinate basis, such that the sub-grid size will adopt low values
        wherever doing so can meet the fractional accuracy and high values only where it is required to meet the
        fractional accuracy. For functions where a wide range of sub-grid sizes allow fractional accuracy to be met
        this ensures the function can be evaluated accurate in a computaionally efficient manner.

        This overcomes a limitation of the `Grid2D` class whereby if a small subset of pixels require high levels of
        sub-gridding to be evaluated accuracy, the entire grid would require this sub-grid size thus leading to
        unecessary expensive function evaluations.

        Parameters

        grid : np.ndarray

        sub_steps : [int] or None
            The sub-size values used to iteratively evaluated the function at high levels of sub-gridding. If None,

        """
        Iterate over a function that returns an array or grid of values until the it meets a specified fractional
        accuracy. The function returns a result on a pixel-grid where evaluating it on more points on a higher
        resolution sub-grid followed by binning lead to a more precise evaluation of the function.

        A full description of the iteration method can be found in the functions *iterated_array_from_func* and
        *iterated_grid_from_func*. This function computes the result on a grid with a sub-size of 1, and uses its
        shape to call the correct function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        func : func
            The function which is iterated over to compute a more precise evaluation.
        cls : object
            The class the function belongs to.
