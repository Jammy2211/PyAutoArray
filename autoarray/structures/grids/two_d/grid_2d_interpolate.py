class Grid2DInterpolate(abstract_grid_2d.AbstractGrid2D):

        """
        Represents a grid of coordinates as described in the `Grid2D` class, but allows for a sparse grid to be used
        to evaluate functions on the grid, the results of which are then interpolated to the grid's native resolution.

        This sparse grid, termed the 'interpolation grid', is computed from the full resolution grid and an input
        pixel_scales_interp. The interpolation grid is laid over the full resolution grid, with all unmasked
        pixels used to set up the interpolation grid. The neighbors of masked pixels are also included, to ensure the
        interpolation evaluate pixels at the edge of the mask

        The decision whether to evaluate the function using the sparse grid and interpolate to th full resolution grid
        is made in the `grid_like_to_grid` decorator. For every function that can receive a Grid2DInterpolate, there is
        an entry in the 'interpolate.ini' config file where a bool determines if the interpolation is used.

        For functions which can be evaluated fast the interpolation should be turned off, ensuring the calculation is
        accurate and precise. However, if the function is slow to evaluate (e.g. it requires numerical integration)
        its bool in this config file should be True, such that the interpolation method is used instead.

        This feature is used in the light profiles and mass profiles of the projects PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens.
        For example, for many mass profiles computing their deflection angles requires expensive numerical integration.
        However, the deflection angles do not vary much locally, so drastically fewer function evaluations can be
        performed by calculating it on a sparse grid interpolating to the full resolution grid.
