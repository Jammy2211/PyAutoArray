    For a sub-grid, every unmasked pixel of its 2D mask with shape (total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels) is divided into

    The sub-grid is returned on an array of shape (total_unmasked_pixels*sub_size**2, 2). y coordinates are

    """
    Determine a projected radial grid of points from a 2D region of coordinates defined by an
    extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax] and with a (y,x) centre. This functions operates as follows:

    1) Given the region defined by the extent [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax], the algorithm finds the longest 1D distance of
    the 4 paths from the (y,x) centre to the edge of the region (e.g. following the positive / negative y and x axes).

    2) Use the pixel-scale corresponding to the direction chosen (e.g. if the positive x-axis was the longest, the
    pixel_scale in the x dimension is used).

    3) Determine the number of pixels between the centre and the edge of the region using the longest path between the
    two chosen above.

    4) Create a (y,x) grid of radial points where all points are at the centre's y value = 0.0 and the x values iterate
    from the centre in increasing steps of the pixel-scale.

    5) Rotate these radial coordinates by the input `angle` clockwise.

    A schematric is shown below:

    -------------------
    |                 |
    |<- - -  - ->x    | x = centre
    |                 | <-> = longest radial path from centre to extent edge
    |                 |
    -------------------

    Using the centre x above, this function finds the longest radial path to the edge of the extent window.

    The returned `grid_radii` represents a radial set of points that in 1D sample the 2D grid outwards from its centre.
    This grid stores the radial coordinates as (y,x) values (where all y values are the same) as opposed to a 1D data
    structure so that it can be used in functions which require that a 2D grid structure is input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    extent : np.ndarray
        The extent of the grid the radii grid is computed using, with format [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]
    centre : (float, flloat)
        The (y,x) central coordinate which the radial grid is traced outwards from.
    pixel_scales : (float, float)

    sub_size : int

    """
    Convert a slimmed grid of 2D (y,x) scaled coordinates to a slimmed grid of pixel indexes. Pixel coordinates are
    returned as integers such that they are the pixel from the top-left of the 2D grid going rights and then downwards.

    The input and output grids are both slimmed and have shapes (total_pixels, 2) and (total_pixels,).

    For example:

    The pixel at the top-left, whose native index is [0,0], corresponds to slimmed pixel index 0.
    The fifth pixel on the top row, whose native index is [0,5], corresponds to slimmed pixel index 4.
    The first pixel on the second row, whose native index is [0,1], has slimmed pixel index 10 if a row has 10 pixels.

    The scaled coordinate grid is defined by the class attribute origin, and coordinates are shifted to this
    origin before computing their 1D grid pixel indexes.
