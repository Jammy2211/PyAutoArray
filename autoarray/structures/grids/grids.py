        """A grid of coordinates, which are paired to a uniform 2D mask of pixels and sub-pixels. Each entry
        on the grid corresponds to the (y,x) coordinates at the centre of a sub-pixel in an unmasked pixel.

        A `Grid` is ordered such that pixels begin from the top-row of the corresponding mask and go right and down.
        The positive y-axis is upwards and positive x-axis to the right.

        The grid can be stored in 1D or 2D, as detailed below.

        Case 1: [sub-size=1, store_in_1d = True]:
        -----------------------------------------

        The Grid is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_pixels, 2], therefore when store_in_1d=True the shape of the
        grid is 2, not 1.

        The first element of the ndarray corresponds to the pixel index and second element the y or x coordinate value.
        For example:

        - grid[3,0] = the 4th unmasked pixel's y-coordinate.
        - grid[6,1] = the 7th unmasked pixel's x-coordinate.

        Below is a visual illustration of a grid, where a total of 10 pixels are unmasked and are included in \
        the grid.

        Case 2: [sub-size>1, store_in_1d=True]:
        ------------------

        If the masks's sub size is > 1, the grid is defined as a sub-grid where each entry corresponds to the (y,x)
        coordinates at the centre of each sub-pixel of an unmasked pixel.

        The sub-grid indexes are ordered such that pixels begin from the first (top-left) sub-pixel in the first
        unmasked pixel. Indexes then go over the sub-pixels in each unmasked pixel, for every unmasked pixel.
        Therefore, the sub-grid is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_pixels*(sub_grid_shape)**2, 2]. For example:

        - grid[9, 1] - using a 2x2 sub-grid, gives the 3rd unmasked pixel's 2nd sub-pixel x-coordinate.
        - grid[9, 1] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 2nd unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel x-coordinate.
        - grid[27, 0] - using a 3x3 sub-grid, gives the 4th unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel y-coordinate.

        Below is a visual illustration of a sub grid. Indexing of each sub-pixel goes from the top-left corner. In
        contrast to the grid above, our illustration below restricts the mask to just 2 pixels, to keep the
        illustration brief.

         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from lens)
         x x x xIoIo x x x x     o = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in lens)
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x

        Our grid with a sub-size looks like it did before:

        pixel_scales = 1.0"

        <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

         x x x x x x x x x x  ^
         x x x x x x x x x x  I
         x x x x x x x x x x  I                        y     x
         x x x x x x x x x x +ve  grid[0] = [0.5,  -1.5]
         x x xI0I1 x x x x x  y   grid[1] = [0.5,  -0.5]
         x x x x x x x x x x -ve
         x x x x x x x x x x  I
         x x x x x x x x x x  I
         x x x x x x x x x x \/
         x x x x x x x x x x

        However, if the sub-size is 2, we go to each unmasked pixel and allocate sub-pixel coordinates for it. For
        example, for pixel 0, if *sub_size=2*, we use a 2x2 sub-grid:

        Pixel 0 - (2x2):
                            y      x
               grid[0] = [0.66, -1.66]
        I0I1I  grid[1] = [0.66, -1.33]
        I2I3I  grid[2] = [0.33, -1.66]
               grid[3] = [0.33, -1.33]

        If we used a sub_size of 3, for the pixel we we would create a 3x3 sub-grid:

                              y      x
                 grid[0] = [0.75, -0.75]
                 grid[1] = [0.75, -0.5]
                 grid[2] = [0.75, -0.25]
        I0I1I2I  grid[3] = [0.5,  -0.75]
        I3I4I5I  grid[4] = [0.5,  -0.5]
        I6I7I8I  grid[5] = [0.5,  -0.25]
                 grid[6] = [0.25, -0.75]
                 grid[7] = [0.25, -0.5]
                 grid[8] = [0.25, -0.25]

        Case 3: [sub_size=1 store_in_1d=False]
        --------------------------------------

        The Grid has the same properties as Case 1, but is stored as an an ndarray of shape
        [total_y_coordinates, total_x_coordinates, 2]. Therefore when store_in_1d=False the shape of the
        grid is 3, not 2.

        All masked entries on the grid has (y,x) values of (0.0, 0.0).

        For the following example mask:

         x x x x x x x x x xI
         x x x x x x x x x xI     This is an example mask.Mask2D, where:
         x x x x x x x x x xI
         x x x xIoIo x x x xI     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the grid)
         x x xIoIoIoIo x x xI     o = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the grid)
         x x xIoIoIoIo x x xI
         x x x x x x x x x xI
         x x x x x x x x x xI
         x x x x x x x x x xI
         x x x x x x x x x xI

        - grid[0,0,0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
        - grid[0,0,1] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
        - grid[3,3,0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
        - grid[3,3,1] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
        - grid[3,4,0] = 1.5
        - grid[3,4,1] = -0.5

        Case 4: [sub_size>1 store_in_1d=False]
        --------------------------------------

        The properties of this grid can be derived by combining Case's 2 and 3 above, whereby the grid is stored as
        an ndarray of shape [total_y_coordinates*sub_size, total_x_coordinates*sub_size, 2].

        All sub-pixels in masked pixels have values (0.0, 0.0).

        Grid Mapping
        ------------

        Every set of (y,x) coordinates in a pixel of the sub-grid maps to an unmasked pixel in the mask. For a uniform
        grid, every (y,x) coordinate directly corresponds to the location of its paired unmasked pixel.

        It is not a requirement that grid is uniform and that their coordinates align with the mask. The input grid
        could be an irregular set of (y,x) coordinates where the indexing signifies that the (y,x) coordinate
        *originates* or *is paired with* the mask's pixels but has had its value change by some aspect of the
        calculation.

        This is important for *PyAutoLens*, where grids in the image-plane are ray-traced and deflected to perform
        lensig calculations. The grid indexing is used to map pixels between the image-plane and source-plane.

        Parameters

        Setup a blurring-grid from a mask, where a blurring grid consists of all pixels that are masked (and
        therefore have their values set to (0.0, 0.0)), but are close enough to the unmasked pixels that their values
        will be convolved into the unmasked those pixels. This occurs in *PyAutoGalaxy* when computing images from
        light profile objects.

        The mask's pixel_scales, sub_size and origin properties are used to compute the blurring grid's (y,x)

        For a PSF of shape (3,3), the following blurring mask is computed (noting that only pixels that are direct
        neighbors of the unmasked pixels above will blur light into an unmasked pixel)

         x x x x x x x x xI     This is an example grid.Mask2D, where

        that all sparse-grid pixels which map inside of an unmasked grid pixel are included on the sparse grid.

        To setup this sparse grid, we thus have two sparse grid:

        - The unmasked sparse-grid, which corresponds to a uniform 2D array of pixels. The edges of this grid
          correspond to the 4 edges of the mask (e.g. the higher and lowest (y,x) scaled unmasked pixels) and the
          grid's shape is speciifed by the unmasked_sparse_grid_shape parameter.

        - The (masked) sparse-grid, which is all pixels on the unmasked sparse-grid above which fall within unmasked
          grid pixels. These are the pixels which are actually used for other modules in PyAutoArray.

        The origin of the unmasked sparse grid can be changed to allow off-center pairings with sparse-grid pixels,
        which is necessary when a mask has a centre offset from (0.0", 0.0"). However, the sparse grid itself
        retains an origin of (0.0", 0.0"), ensuring its scaled grid uses the same coordinate system as the
        other grid.
