        This is performed as follows:

        1) Use the mean value of the grid's y and x coordinates to determine the origin of the grid.
        2) Compute the radial distance of every grid coordinate from the origin.
        3) For every coordinate, find its nearest pixel in the border.
        4) Determine if it is outside the border, by comparing its radial distance from the origin to its paired \
           border pixel's radial distance.
        5) If its radial distance is larger, use the ratio of radial distances to move the coordinate to the border \
           (if its inside the border, do nothing).

        The method can be used on uniform or irregular grids, however for irregular grids the border of the
        'image-plane' mask is used to define border pixels.
