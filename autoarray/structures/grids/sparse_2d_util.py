    Returns the util between every sparse-rid pixel and masked pixel on a grid. This is performed by checking whether
    each pixel is within the masks and then mapping their indexes.

    Spare pixels are paired with the next masked pixel index. This may mean that a pixel is not paired with a
    pixel near it, if the next pixel is on the next row of the grid. This is not a problem, as it is only
    unmasked pixels that are referenced when perform certain mapping where this information is not required.

        The centres of the unmasked pixelization grid pixels.
