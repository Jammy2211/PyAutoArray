        """
        Represents a grid of coordinates as described for the ``Grid2D`` class, but using an iterative sub-grid that
        adapts its resolution when it is input into a function that performs an analytic calculation.

        A ``Grid2D`` represents (y,x) coordinates using a sub-grid, where functions are evaluated once at every coordinate
        on the sub-grid and averaged to give a more precise evaluation an analytic function. A ``Grid2DIterate`` does not
        have a specified sub-grid size, but instead iteratively recomputes the analytic function at increasing sub-grid
        sizes until an input fractional accuracy is reached.

        Iteration is performed on a per (y,x) coordinate basis, such that the sub-grid size will adopt low values
        wherever doing so can meet the fractional accuracy and high values only where it is required to meet the
        fractional accuracy. For functions where a wide range of sub-grid sizes allow fractional accuracy to be met
        this ensures the function can be evaluated accurate in a computaionally efficient manner.

        This overcomes a limitation of the ``Grid2D`` class whereby if a small subset of pixels require high levels of
        sub-gridding to be evaluated accuracy, the entire grid would require this sub-grid size thus leading to
        unecessary expensive function evaluations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The (y,x) coordinates of the grid.
        mask
            The 2D mask associated with the grid, defining the pixels each grid coordinate is paired with and
            originates from.
        fractional_accuracy
            The fractional accuracy the function evaluated must meet to be accepted, where this accuracy is the ratio
            of the value at a higher sub size to the value computed using the previous sub_size. The fractional
            accuracy does not depend on the units or magnitude of the function being evaluated.
        relative_accuracy
            The relative accuracy the function evaluted must meet to be accepted, where this value is the absolute
            difference of the values computed using the higher sub size and lower sub size grids. The relative
            accuracy depends on the units / magnitude of the function being evaluated.
        sub_steps
            The sub-size values used to iteratively evaluated the function at high levels of sub-gridding. If None,
            they are setup as the default values [2, 4, 8, 16].
        store_native
            If True, the ndarray is stored in its native format [total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels, 2]. This avoids
            mapping large data arrays to and from the slim / native formats, which can be a computational bottleneck.

        Iterate over a function that returns an array or grid of values until the it meets a specified fractional

        shape to call the correct function.

        func
            The function which is iterated over to compute a more precise evaluation.
        cls
            The class the function belongs to.
