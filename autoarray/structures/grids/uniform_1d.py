    def __init__(
        self,

        """
        A grid of 1D (x) coordinates, which are paired to a uniform 1D mask of pixels. Each entry
        on the grid corresponds to the (x) coordinates at the centre of a pixel of an unmasked pixel.

        A `Grid1D` is ordered such that pixels begin from the left (e.g. index [0]) of the corresponding mask
        and go right. The positive x-axis is to the right.

        The grid can be stored in two formats:

        - slimmed: all masked entries are removed so the ndarray is shape [total_unmasked_coordinates, 2]
        - native: it retains the original shape of the grid so the ndarray is
          shape [total_unmasked_coordinates, 2].


        __slim__

        The Grid1D is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_coordinates].

        The first element of the ndarray corresponds to the pixel index. For example:

        - grid[3] = the 4th unmasked pixel's x-coordinate.
        - grid[6] = the 7th unmasked pixel's x-coordinate.

        Below is a visual illustration of a grid, where a total of 3 pixels are unmasked and are included in the grid.

        .. code-block:: bash

            <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

            x x x O o x O x x x

        This is an example mask.Mask1D, where:

        .. code-block:: bash

            x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the grid)
            O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the grid)

        The mask pixel index's will come out like this (and the direction of scaled coordinates is highlighted
        around the mask.

        .. code-block:: bash

            pixel_scales = 1.0"

            <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

            x x x 0 1 x 2 x x x

            grid[0] = [-1.5]
            grid[1] = [-0.5]
            grid[2] = [1.5]


        __native__

        The Grid2D has the same properties as Case 1, but is stored as an an ndarray of shape [total_x_coordinates].

        All masked entries on the grid has (y,x) values of (0.0, 0.0).

        For the following example mask:

        .. code-block:: bash

            x x x O O x O x x x

            - grid[0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[1] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[2] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[3] = -1.5
            - grid[4] = -0.5
            - grid[5] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - grid[6] = 0.5

        **Grid1D Mapping**

        Every set of (x) coordinates in a pixel of the grid maps to an unmasked pixel in the mask. For a uniform
        grid, every x coordinate directly corresponds to the location of its paired unmasked pixel.

        It is not a requirement that grid is uniform and that their coordinates align with the mask. The input grid
        could be an irregular set of x coordinates where the indexing signifies that the x coordinate
        *originates* or *is paired with* the mask's pixels but has had its value change by some aspect of the
        calculation.

        This is important for the child project *PyAutoLens*, where grids in the image-plane are ray-traced and
        deflected to perform lensing calculations. The grid indexing is used to map pixels between the image-plane and
        source-plane.
