    """
    For a sub-grid, every unmasked pixel of its 1D mask with shape (total_pixels,) is divided into a finer uniform
    grid of shape (total_pixels*sub_size, ). This routine computes the (x) scaled coordinates at the centre of every
    sub-pixel defined by a 1D shape of the overall grid.

    Grid2D are defined from left to right, where the first unmasked sub-pixel corresponds to index 0. Sub-pixels that
    are part of the same mask array pixel are indexed next to one another, such that the second
    sub-pixel in the first pixel has index 1, its next sub-pixel has index 2, and so forth.

    The sub-grid is returned on an array of shape (total_unmasked_pixels*sub_size, ).

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape_slim : (int, int)
        The (x) shape of the 1D array the sub-grid of coordinates is computed for.
    pixel_scales : (float, float)
        The (x) scaled units to pixel units conversion factor of the 1D mask array.
    sub_size : int
        The size of the sub-grid that each pixel of the 1D mask array is divided into.
    origin : (float, flloat)
        The (x) origin of the 1D array, which the sub-grid is shifted around.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        A sub grid of (x) scaled coordinates at the centre of every pixel unmasked pixel on the 2D mask
        array. The sub grid array has dimensions (total_unmasked_pixels*sub_size, ).

    --------
    sub_grid_1d = grid_1d_via_shape_slim_from(mask=mask, pixel_scales=(0.5, 0.5), sub_size=2, origin=(0.0, 0.0))

    """
    For a native 1D grid and mask of shape [total_pixels], map the values of all unmasked pixels to a slimmed grid of
    shape [total_unmasked_pixels].

    The pixel coordinate origin is at the left of the native grid and goes right-wards, such
    that for a grid of shape (4,) where pixels 0, 1 and 3 are unmasked:

    - pixel [0] of the 1D native grid will correspond to index 0 of the 1D grid.

    - pixel [3] of the 1D native grid will correspond to index 2 of the 1D grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid_1d_native : ndarray
        The native grid of (x) values which are mapped to the slimmed grid.
    mask_1d : np.ndarray
        A 1D array of bools, where `False` values mean unmasked and are included in the mapping.
    sub_size : int
        The size (sub_size x sub_size) of each unmasked pixels sub-array.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray

    """
    For a slimmed 1D grid of shape [total_unmasked_pixels*sub_size], that was computed by extracting the unmasked values
    from a native 1D grid of shape [total_pixels*sub_size], map the slimmed grid's coordinates back to the native 1D
    grid where masked values are set to zero.

    This uses a 1D array 'slim_to_native' where each index gives the 1D pixel indexes of the grid's native unmasked
    pixels, for example:

    - If slim_to_native[0] = [0], the first value of the 1D slimmed grid maps to the pixel [0] of the native 1D grid.
    - If slim_to_native[1] = [2], the second value of the 1D slimmed grid maps to the pixel [2] of the native 1D grid.
    - If slim_to_native[4] = [9], the fifth value of the 1D slimmed grid maps to the pixels [9] of the native 1D grid.

    Parameters
    ----------
