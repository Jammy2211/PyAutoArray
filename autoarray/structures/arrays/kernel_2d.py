        """
        A 2D convolution kernel stored as an array of values paired to a uniform 2D mask.

        The ``Kernel2D`` is a subclass of ``Array2D`` with additional methods for performing
        point spread function (PSF) convolution of images or mapping matrices. Each entry of
        the kernel corresponds to a PSF value at the centre of a pixel in the unmasked grid.

        Two convolution modes are supported:

        - **Real-space convolution**: performed directly via sliding-window summation or
          ``jax.scipy.signal.convolve``. This is exact but can be slow for large kernels.
        - **FFT convolution**: performed by transforming both the kernel and the input image
          into Fourier space, multiplying, and transforming back. This is typically faster
          for kernels larger than ~5Ã—5, but requires careful zero-padding.

        When using FFT convolution, the input image and mask are automatically padded such
        that the FFT avoids circular wrap-around artefacts. This padding is computed from the
        kernel size via :meth:`fft_shape_from`. The padded shape is stored in ``fft_shape``.
        If FFT convolution is attempted without precomputing and applying this padding,
        an exception is raised to avoid silent shape mismatches.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The raw 2D kernel values. Can be normalised to sum to unity if ``normalize=True``.
        mask
            The 2D mask associated with the kernel, defining the pixels each kernel value is
            paired with.
        header
            Optional metadata (e.g. FITS header) associated with the kernel.
        normalize
            If True, the kernel values are rescaled such that they sum to 1.0.
        store_native
            If True, the kernel is stored in its full native 2D form as an attribute
            ``stored_native`` for re-use (e.g. when convolving repeatedly).
        image_mask
            Optional mask defining the unmasked image pixels when performing convolution.
            If not provided, defaults to the supplied ``mask``.
        blurring_mask
            Optional mask defining the "blurring region": pixels outside the image mask
            into which PSF flux can spread. Used to construct blurring images and
            blurring mapping matrices.
        mask_shape
            The shape of the (unpadded) mask region. Used when cropping back results after
            FFT convolution.
        full_shape
            The unpadded image + kernel shape (``image_shape + kernel_shape - 1``).
        fft_shape
            The padded shape used in FFT convolution, typically computed via
            ``scipy.fft.next_fast_len`` for efficiency. Must be precomputed before calling
            FFT convolution methods.
        use_fft
            If True, convolution is performed in Fourier space with zero-padding.
            If False, convolution is performed in real space.
            If None, a default choice is made: real space for small kernels,
            FFT for large kernels.
        *args, **kwargs
            Passed to the ``Array2D`` constructor.

        Notes
        -----
        - FFT padding can be disabled globally with ``disable_fft_pad=True`` when
          constructing ``Imaging`` objects, in which case convolution will either
          use real space or proceed without padding.
        - Blurring masks ensure that PSF flux spilling outside the main image mask
          is included correctly. Omitting them may lead to underestimated PSF wings.
        - For unit tests with tiny kernels, FFT and real-space convolution may differ
          slightly due to edge and truncation effects.

        Compute the padded shapes required for FFT-based convolution with this kernel.

        FFT convolution requires the input image and kernel to be zero-padded so that
        the convolution is equivalent to linear convolution (not circular) and to avoid
        wrap-around artefacts. This method inspects the mask and the kernel shape to
        determine three key shapes:

        - ``mask_shape``: the rectangular bounding-box region of the mask that encloses
          all unmasked (False) pixels, padded by half the kernel size in each direction.
          This is the minimal region that must be retained for convolution.
        - ``full_shape``: the "linear convolution shape", equal to
          ``mask_shape + kernel_shape - 1``. This is the minimal padded size required
          for an exact linear convolution.
        - ``fft_shape``: the FFT-efficient padded shape, obtained by rounding each
          dimension of ``full_shape`` up to the next fast length for real FFTs
          (via ``scipy.fft.next_fast_len``). Using this ensures efficient FFT execution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mask
            A 2D mask where False indicates unmasked pixels (valid data) and True
            indicates masked pixels. The bounding-box of the False region is used
            to compute the convolution region.

        Returns
        -------
        full_shape
            The unpadded linear convolution shape (mask region + kernel âˆ’ 1).
        fft_shape
            The FFT-friendly padded shape for efficient convolution.
        mask_shape
            The rectangular mask region size including kernel padding.

        Convolve an input masked image with this PSF.

        This method chooses between an FFT-based convolution (default if
        ``self.use_fft=True``) or a direct real-space convolution, depending on
        how the Kernel2D was configured.

        In the FFT branch:
        - The input image (and optional blurring image) are resized / padded to
          match the FFT-friendly padded shape (``fft_shape``) associated with this kernel.
        - The PSF and image are transformed to Fourier space via ``jax.numpy.fft.rfft2``.
        - Convolution is performed as elementwise multiplication.
        - The result is inverse-transformed and cropped back to the masked region.

        Padding ensures that the FFT implements *linear* convolution, not circular,
        and avoids wrap-around artefacts. The required padding is determined by
        ``fft_shape_from(mask)``. If no precomputed shapes exist, they are computed
        on the fly. For reproducible behaviour, precompute and set
        ``fft_shape``, ``full_shape``, and ``mask_shape`` on the kernel.

        If ``use_fft=False``, convolution falls back to
        :meth:`Kernel2D.convolved_image_via_real_space_from`.

        Convolve a source-plane mapping matrix with this PSF.

        This method performs the equivalent operation of PSF convolution on the
        mapping matrix, so that model visibilities / images can be computed via
        matrix multiplication instead of explicit convolution.

        If ``use_fft=True``, convolution is performed in Fourier space:
        - The mapping matrix is scattered into a 3D native cube
          (ny, nx, n_src).

        - The inverse FFT is taken and cropped to the mask region.

        Notes
        -----
        - FFT convolution requires that ``self.fft_shape`` and related padding
          attributes are precomputed. If not, a ``ValueError`` is raised with the
          expected vs actual shapes. This ensures the mapping matrix is padded
          consistently with the PSF.
        - The optional ``blurring_mapping_matrix`` plays the same role as
          ``blurring_image`` in :meth:`convolved_image_from`, accounting for PSF flux
          that falls into the masked region from outside.

        """
        Return a version of this kernel rescaled so both dimensions are odd-sized.

        Odd-sized kernels are often required for real space convolution operations
        (e.g. centered PSFs in imaging pipelines). If the kernel has one or two
        even-sized dimensions, they are rescaled (via interpolation) and padded
        so that both dimensions are odd.

        The kernel can also be scaled larger or smaller by changing
        ``rescale_factor``. Rescaling uses ``skimage.transform.rescale`` /
        ``resize``, which interpolate pixel values and may introduce small
        inaccuracies compared to native instrument PSFs. Where possible, users
        should generate odd-sized PSFs directly from data reduction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rescale_factor
            Factor by which the kernel is rescaled. If 1.0, only adjusts size to
            nearest odd dimensions. Values > 1 enlarge, < 1 shrink the kernel.

        Convolve an input masked image with this PSF in real space.

        space.

        image
            Masked image array to convolve.
