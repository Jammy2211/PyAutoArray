    For a slimmed array with indexes mapping the slimmed array values to their native array, return the native 2D
    array.

    The pixel coordinate origin is at the top left corner of the 2D array and goes right-wards and downwards.

    For example, for an array of shape (3,3) and where all pixels are unmasked:

    - pixel [0,0] of the native 2D array will correspond to index 0 of the slim array.
    - pixel [0,1] of the native 2D array will correspond to index 1 of the slim array.
    - pixel [1,0] of the native 2D array will correspond to index 3 of the slim array.
    - pixel [2,0] of the native 2D array will correspond to index 6 of the slim array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_2d_slim
        The slimmed array of shape [total_values] which are mapped to the native array..
    shape
        The 2D dimensions of the native 2D array.
    native_index_for_slim_index_2d : np.narray
        An array of shape [total_values] that maps from the slimmed array to the native array.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The native 2D array of values mapped from the slimmed array with dimensions (total_values, total_values).
    """
    return (
        jnp.zeros(shape).at[tuple(native_index_for_slim_index_2d.T)].set(array_2d_slim)
    )
