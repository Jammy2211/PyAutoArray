        """
        A uniform 2D array of values, which are paired with a 2D mask of pixels which may be split into sub-pixels.

        The ``Array2D`, like all data structures (e.g. ``Grid2D``, ``VectorYX2D``) has in-built functionality which:

        - Applies a 2D mask (a ``Mask2D`` object) to the da_ta structure's values.

        - Maps the data structure between two data representations: `slim`` (all unmasked values in
          a 1D ``ndarray``) and ``native`` (all unmasked values in a 2D ``ndarray``).

        - Associates Cartesian ``Grid2D`` objects of (y,x) coordinates with the data structure (e.g.
          a (y,x) grid of all unmasked pixels).

        - Associates sub-grids with the data structure, which perform calculations higher resolutions which are then
          binned up.

        Each entry of an ``Array2D`` corresponds to a value at the centre of a sub-pixel in its
        corresponding ``Mask2D``.  It is ordered such that pixels begin from the top-row of the corresponding mask
        and go right and down. The positive y-axis is upwards and positive x-axis to the right.

        A detailed description of the data structure API is provided below.

        **SLIM DATA REPRESENTATION (sub-size=1)**

        Below is a visual illustration of an ``Array2D``'s 2D mask, where a total of 10 pixels are unmasked and are
        included in the array.

        ::

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example ``Mask2D``, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the array)
             x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the array)
             x x x O O O O x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x

        The mask pixel index's are as follows (the positive / negative direction of the ``Grid2D`` objects associated
        with the array are also shown on the y and x axes).

        ::

            <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

             x x x x x x x x x x  ^   array_2d[0] = 10
             x x x x x x x x x x  I   array_2d[1] = 20
             x x x x x x x x x x  I   array_2d[2] = 30

             x x x x x x x x x x      array_2d[9] = 100

        The ``Array2D`` in its ``slim`` data representation is an ``ndarray`` of shape [total_unmasked_pixels].

        For the ``Mask2D`` above the ``slim`` representation therefore contains 10 entries and two examples of these
        entries are:

        ::

            array[3] = the 4th unmasked pixel's value, given by value 40 above.
            array[6] = the 7th unmasked pixel's value, given by value 80 above.

        A Cartesian grid of (y,x) coordinates, corresponding to all ``slim`` values (e.g. unmasked pixels) is given
        by ``array_2d.derive_grid.masked.slim``.


        **NATIVE DATA REPRESENTATION (sub_size=1)**

        The ``Array2D`` above, but represented as an an ``ndarray`` of shape [total_y_values, total_x_values], where
        all masked entries have values of 0.0.

        For the following mask:

        ::

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example ``Mask2D``, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the array)
             x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the array)
             x x x O O O O x x x

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x

        Where the array has the following indexes (left figure) and values (right):

        ::

            <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

             x x x x x x x x x x  ^   array_2d[0] = 10

             x x x x x x x x x x  I   array_2d[7] = 80
             x x x x x x x x x x \/   array_2d[8] = 90
             x x x x x x x x x x      array_2d[9] = 100

        In the above array:

        ::

            - array[0,0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - array[0,0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - array[3,3] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - array[3,3] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
            - array[3,4] = 10
            - array[3,5] = 20
            - array[4,5] = 50

        **SLIM TO NATIVE MAPPING**

        The ``Array2D`` has functionality which maps data between the ``slim`` and ``native`` data representations.

        For the example mask above, the 1D ``ndarray`` given by ``mask.derive_indexes.slim_to_native`` is:

        ::

            slim_to_native[0] = [3,4]
            slim_to_native[1] = [3,5]
            slim_to_native[2] = [4,3]
            slim_to_native[3] = [4,4]
            slim_to_native[4] = [4,5]
            slim_to_native[5] = [4,6]
            slim_to_native[6] = [5,3]
            slim_to_native[7] = [5,4]
            slim_to_native[8] = [5,5]
            slim_to_native[9] = [5,6]

        **SUB GRIDDING**

        If the ``Mask2D`` ``sub_size`` is > 1, the array has entries corresponding to the values at the centre of
        every sub-pixel of each unmasked pixel.

        The sub-array indexes are ordered such that pixels begin from the first (top-left) sub-pixel in the first
        unmasked pixel. Indexes then go over the sub-pixels in each unmasked pixel, for every unmasked pixel.

        Therefore, the shapes of the sub-array are as follows:

        - ``slim`` representation: an ``ndarray`` of shape [total_unmasked_pixels*sub_size**2].
        - ``native`` representation: an ``ndarray`` of shape [total_y_values*sub_size, total_x_values*sub_size].

        Below is a visual illustration of a sub array. Indexing of each sub-pixel goes from the top-left corner. In
        contrast to the array above, our illustration below restricts the mask to just 2 pixels, to keep the
        illustration brief.

        ::

             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example ``Mask2D``, where:
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from lens)
             x 0 0 x x x x x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in lens)
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x
             x x x x x x x x x x

        If ``sub_size=2``, each unmasked pixel has 4 (2x2) sub-pixel values. For the example above, pixels 0 and 1
        each have 4 values which map to the ``array_2d``'s ``slim`` representation as follows:

        ::

            Pixel 0 - (2x2):

                   array_2d.slim[0] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 0.
             0 1   array_2d.slim[1] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 1.
             2 3   array_2d.slim[2] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 2.
                   array_2d.slim[3] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 3.

            Pixel 1 - (2x2):

                   array_2d.slim[4] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 0.
             4 5   array_2d.slim[5] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 1.
             6 7   array_2d.slim[6] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 2.
                   array_2d.slim[7] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 3.

        For the ``native`` data representation we get the following mappings:

        ::

            Pixel 0 - (2x2):

                   array_2d.native[8, 2] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 0.
             0 1   array_2d.native[8, 3] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 1.
             2 3   array_2d.native[9, 2] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 2.
                   array_2d.native[9, 3] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 3.

            Pixel 1 - (2x2):

                   array_2d.native[10, 4] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 0.
             4 5   array_2d.native[10, 5] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 1.
             6 7   array_2d.native[11, 4] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 2.
                   array_2d.native[11, 5] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 3.

            Other entries (all masked sub-pixels are zero):

                   array_2d.native[0, 0] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)
                   array_2d.native[15, 12] = 0.0 (it is masked, thus zero)

        If we used a sub_size of 3, for pixel 0 we we would create a 3x3 sub-array:

        ::

                     array_2d.slim[0] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 0.
                     array_2d.slim[1] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 1.
                     array_2d.slim[2] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 2.
             0 1 2   array_2d.slim[3] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 3.
             3 4 5   array_2d.slim[4] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 4.
             6 7 8   array_2d.slim[5] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 5.
                     array_2d.slim[6] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 6.
                     array_2d.slim[7] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 7.
                     array_2d.slim[8] = value of first sub-pixel in pixel 8.

        In **PyAutoCTI** all `Array2D` objects are used in their `native` representation without sub-gridding.
        Significant memory can be saved by only store this format, thus the `native_binned_only` config override
        can force this behaviour. It is recommended users do not use this option to avoid unexpected behaviour.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The values of the array, which can be input in the ``slim`` or ``native`` format.
        mask
            The 2D mask associated with the array, defining the pixels each array value in its ``slim`` representation
            is paired with.
        store_native
            If True, the ndarray is stored in its native format [total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels]. This avoids
            mapping large data arrays to and from the slim / native formats, which can be a computational bottleneck.

        Examples
        --------

        This example uses the ``Array2D.no_mask`` method to create the ``Array2D``.

        Different methods using different inputs are available and documented throughout this webpage.

        The binning up process converts a array from (y,x) values where each value is a coordinate on the sub-array to
        (y,x) values where each coordinate is at the centre of its mask (e.g. a array with a sub_size of 1). This is
        performed by taking the mean of all (y,x) values in each sub pixel.

        Significant memory can be saved by only store this format, thus the `native_binned_only` config override
