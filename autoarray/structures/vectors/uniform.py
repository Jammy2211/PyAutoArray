        """
        A collection of (y,x) vectors which are located on a regular 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates.

        The vectors are paired to a uniform 2D mask of pixels and sub-pixels. Each vector corresponds to a value at
        the centre of a sub-pixel in an unmasked pixel.

        The `VectorYX2D` is ordered such that pixels begin from the top-row of the corresponding mask and go right
        and down. The positive y-axis is upwards and positive x-axis to the right.

        The (y,x) vectors are stored as a NumPy array which has the `slim` and `native shapes described below.
        Irrespective of this shape, the last dimension of the data structure storing the vectors is always shape 2,
        corresponding to the y and x vectors. [total_vectors, 2].

        Calculations should use the NumPy array structure wherever possible for efficient calculations.

        The vectors input to this function can have any of the following forms (they will be converted to the 1D NumPy
        array structure and can be converted back using the object's properties):

        [[vector_0_y, vector_0_x], [vector_1_y, vector_1_x]]
        [(vector_0_y, vector_0_x), (vector_1_y, vector_1_x)]

        If your vector field lies on a 2D irregular grid of data the `VectorFieldIrregular2D` data structure should be
        used.


        **Case 1 (sub-size=1, slim)**

        The Vector2D is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_pixels, 2].

        The first element of the ndarray corresponds to the pixel index, for example:

        - vector[3, 0:2] = the 4th unmasked pixel's y and x values.
        - vector[6, 0:2] = the 7th unmasked pixel's y and x values.

        Below is a visual illustration of a vector, where a total of 10 pixels are unmasked and are included in
        the vector.

         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example `Mask2D`, where:
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the vector)
         x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the vector)
         x x x O O O O x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x

        The mask pixel index's will come out like this (and the direction of scaled values is highlighted
        around the mask).

        pixel_scales = 1.0"

                                                        y      x
         x x x x x x x x x x  ^   vector[0, :] = 0
         x x x x x x x x x x  I   vector[1, :] = 1

         x x x x x x x x x x      vector[9, :] = 9


        **Case 2 (sub-size>1, slim)**

        If the masks's sub size is > 1, the vector is defined as a sub-vector where each entry corresponds to the
        values at the centre of each sub-pixel of an unmasked pixel.

        The sub-vector indexes are ordered such that pixels begin from the first (top-left) sub-pixel in the first
        unmasked pixel. Indexes then go over the sub-pixels in each unmasked pixel, for every unmasked pixel.
        Therefore, the sub-vector is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_pixels*(sub_array_shape)**2, 2]. For example:

        - vector[9, 0:2] - using a 2x2 sub-vector, gives the 3rd unmasked pixel's 2nd sub-pixel y and x values.
        - vector[9, 0:2] - using a 3x3 sub-vector, gives the 2nd unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel y and x values.
        - vector[27, 0:2] - using a 3x3 sub-vector, gives the 4th unmasked pixel's 1st sub-pixel y and x values.

        Below is a visual illustration of a sub vector. Indexing of each sub-pixel goes from the top-left corner. In
        contrast to the vector above, our illustration below restricts the mask to just 2 pixels, to keep the
        illustration brief.

         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example `Mask2D`, where:
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from lens)
         x x x x O O x x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in lens)
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x

        Our vector with a sub-size looks like it did before:

        <--- -ve  x  +ve -->

         x x x x x x x x x x  ^
         x x x x x x x x x x  I
         x x x x x x x x x x  I
         x x x x x x x x x x +ve
         x x x 0 1 x x x x x  y
         x x x x x x x x x x -ve
         x x x x x x x x x x  I
         x x x x x x x x x x  I
         x x x x x x x x x x \/
         x x x x x x x x x x

        However, if the sub-size is 2,each unmasked pixel has a set of sub-pixels with values. For example, for pixel 0,
        if `sub_size=2`, it has 4 values on a 2x2 sub-vector:

        Pixel 0 - (2x2):

               vector[0, 0:2] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 0.
        I0I1I  vector[1, 0:2] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 1.
        I2I3I  vector[2, 0:2] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 2.
               vector[3, 0:2] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 3.

        If we used a sub_size of 3, for the first pixel we we would create a 3x3 sub-vector:


                 vector[0] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 0.
                 vector[1] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 1.
                 vector[2] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 2.
        I0I1I2I  vector[3] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 3.
        I3I4I5I  vector[4] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 4.
        I6I7I8I  vector[5] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 5.
                 vector[6] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 6.
                 vector[7] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 7.
                 vector[8] = y and x values of first sub-pixel in pixel 8.


        **Case 3 (sub_size=1, native)**

        The Vector2D has the same properties as Case 1, but is stored as an an ndarray of shape
        [total_y_values, total_x_values, 2].

        All masked entries on the vector have values of 0.0.

        For the following example mask:

         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example `Mask2D`, where:
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the vector)
         x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the vector)
         x x x O O O O x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x

        For the example above:

            - vector[0,0, 0:2] = [0.0, 0.0] (it is masked, thus zero)
            - vector[0,0, 0:2] = [0.0, 0.0] (it is masked, thus zero)
            - vector[3,3, 0:2] = [0.0, 0.0] (it is masked, thus zero)
            - vector[3,3, 0:2] = [0.0, 0.0] (it is masked, thus zero)
            - vector[3,4, 0:2] = [0, 0]
            - vector[3,4, 0:2] = [-1, -1]


        **Case 4: (sub_size>, native)**

        The properties of this vector can be derived by combining Case's 2 and 3 above, whereby the vector is stored as
        an ndarray of shape [total_y_values*sub_size, total_x_values*sub_size, 2].

        All sub-pixels in masked pixels have values 0.0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The 2D (y,x) vectors on a regular grid that represent the vector-field.
        grid
            The regular grid of (y,x) coordinates where each vector is located.
        mask
            The 2D mask associated with the array, defining the pixels each array value is paired with and
            originates from.
        store_native
            If True, the ndarray is stored in its native format [total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels, 2]. This avoids
            mapping large data arrays to and from the slim / native formats, which can be a computational bottleneck.

        Create a `VectorYX2D` (see `AbstractVectorYX2D.__new__`) where all values are filled with 1.0, analogous to
        the method np.zeros().

        From 1D input the method cannot determine the 2D shape of the array and its mask, thus the shape_native must be
        input into this method. The mask is setup as a unmasked `Mask2D` of shape_native.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fill_value
            The value all array elements are filled with.
        pixel_scales
            The (y,x) arcsecond-to-pixel units conversion factor of every pixel. If this is input as a `float`,
            it is converted to a (float, float).
        sub_size
            The size (sub_size x sub_size) of each unmasked pixels sub-grid.
        origin
            The (y,x) scaled units origin of the mask's coordinate system.
