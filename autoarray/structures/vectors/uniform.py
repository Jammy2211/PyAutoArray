        """
        A collection of (y,x) vectors which are located on a regular 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates.

        The vectors are paired to a uniform 2D mask of pixels. Each vector corresponds to a value at
        the centre of a pixel in an unmasked pixel.

        The `VectorYX2D` is ordered such that pixels begin from the top-row of the corresponding mask and go right
        and down. The positive y-axis is upwards and positive x-axis to the right.

        The (y,x) vectors are stored as a NumPy array which has the `slim` and `native shapes described below.
        Irrespective of this shape, the last dimension of the data structure storing the vectors is always shape 2,
        corresponding to the y and x vectors. [total_vectors, 2].

        Calculations should use the NumPy array structure wherever possible for efficient calculations.

        The vectors input to this function can have any of the following forms (they will be converted to the 1D NumPy
        array structure and can be converted back using the object's properties):

        [[vector_0_y, vector_0_x], [vector_1_y, vector_1_x]]
        [(vector_0_y, vector_0_x), (vector_1_y, vector_1_x)]

        If your vector field lies on a 2D irregular grid of data the `VectorFieldIrregular2D` data structure should be
        used.


        __slim__

        The Vector2D is an ndarray of shape [total_unmasked_pixels, 2].

        The first element of the ndarray corresponds to the pixel index, for example:

        - vector[3, 0:2] = the 4th unmasked pixel's y and x values.
        - vector[6, 0:2] = the 7th unmasked pixel's y and x values.

        Below is a visual illustration of a vector, where a total of 10 pixels are unmasked and are included in
        the vector.

         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example `Mask2D`, where:
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the vector)
         x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the vector)
         x x x O O O O x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x

        The mask pixel index's will come out like this (and the direction of scaled values is highlighted
        around the mask).

        pixel_scales = 1.0"

        __native__

        The Vector2D has the same properties as Case 1, but is stored as an an ndarray of shape
        [total_y_values, total_x_values, 2].

        All masked entries on the vector have values of 0.0.

        For the following example mask:

         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x     This is an example `Mask2D`, where:
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x O O x x x x     x = `True` (Pixel is masked and excluded from the vector)
         x x x O O O O x x x     O = `False` (Pixel is not masked and included in the vector)
         x x x O O O O x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x
         x x x x x x x x x x

        For the example above:

            - vector[0,0, 0:2] = [0.0, 0.0] (it is masked, thus zero)
            - vector[0,0, 0:2] = [0.0, 0.0] (it is masked, thus zero)
            - vector[3,3, 0:2] = [0.0, 0.0] (it is masked, thus zero)
            - vector[3,3, 0:2] = [0.0, 0.0] (it is masked, thus zero)
            - vector[3,4, 0:2] = [0, 0]
            - vector[3,4, 0:2] = [-1, -1]

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The 2D (y,x) vectors on a regular grid that represent the vector-field.
        grid
            The regular grid of (y,x) coordinates where each vector is located.
        mask
            The 2D mask associated with the array, defining the pixels each array value is paired with and
            originates from.
        store_native
            If True, the ndarray is stored in its native format [total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels, 2]. This avoids
            mapping large data arrays to and from the slim / native formats, which can be a computational bottleneck.
