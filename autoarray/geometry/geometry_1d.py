        """
        A 1D geometry, representing a uniform rectangular grid of (x) coordinates which has ``shape_native``.

        This class is used for converting coordinates from pixel-units to scaled coordinates via
        the geometry's (x) ``pixel_scales`` conversion factor and its (y,x) ``origin``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape_native
            The 1D shape of the array in its ``native`` format (and its 1D mask) whose 1D geometry this object
            represents.
        pixel_scales
            The (x) scaled units to pixel units conversion factors of every pixel. If this is input as a `float`,
            it is converted to a (float,) structure.
        origin
            The (x) scaled units origin of the mask's coordinate system.

    def shape_slim_scaled(self) -> Tuple[float]:
        """
        The (x) 1D slim (and native) shape of the geometry in scaled units.

        This is computed by multiplying the 2D ``shape_native`` (units ``pixels``) with
        the ``pixel_scales`` (units ``scaled/pixels``) conversion factor.

    @property
    def scaled_maxima(self) -> Tuple[float]:
        """
        The maximum (x) scaled coordinates of the 1D geometry.

        For example, if the geometry's most positive scaled x value is 20.0, this returns (20.0,).

    @property
    def scaled_minima(self) -> Tuple[float]:
        """
        The minimum (x) scaled coordinates of the 1D geometry.

        For example, if the geometry's most negative scaled x value is -20.0, this returns (-20.0,).
