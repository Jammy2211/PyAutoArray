    Convert a native grid of 2D (y,x) scaled coordinates to a native grid of 2D (y,x) pixel values. Pixel coordinates
    are returned as integers such that they map directly to the pixel they are contained within.

    The input and output grids are both native resolution and therefore have shape (y_pixels, x_pixels, 2).

    The pixel coordinate origin is at the top left corner of the grid, such that the pixel [0,0] corresponds to
    the highest (most positive) y scaled coordinate and lowest (most negative) x scaled coordinate on the gird.

    The scaled coordinate grid is defined by the class attribute origin, and coordinates are shifted to this
