    Convert a slimmed grid of 2D (y,x) scaled coordinates to a slimmed grid of pixel indexes. Pixel coordinates are
    returned as integers such that they are the pixel from the top-left of the 2D grid going rights and then downwards.

    The input and output grids are both slimmed and have shapes (total_pixels, 2) and (total_pixels,).

    For example:

    The pixel at the top-left, whose native index is [0,0], corresponds to slimmed pixel index 0.
    The fifth pixel on the top row, whose native index is [0,5], corresponds to slimmed pixel index 4.
    The first pixel on the second row, whose native index is [0,1], has slimmed pixel index 10 if a row has 10 pixels.
