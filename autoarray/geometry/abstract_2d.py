        The extent of the 2D geometry in scaled units, returned as (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max).

        This format matches the ``extent`` argument of ``matplotlib.pyplot.imshow``, with x and y
        swapped relative to the usual (y,x) PyAutoArray convention. Subclasses must implement this.

    def extent_square(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]:
        """
        The extent of the 2D geometry in scaled units, expanded so that the y and x ranges are equal.

        This ensures that a uniform grid with square pixels can be laid over this extent, which is
        useful for constructing interpolation grids used in visualization. The centre of the extent
        is preserved; whichever axis has the smaller range is expanded symmetrically to match the
        larger one.

        (x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max)
            The square extent in scaled units following the matplotlib ``imshow`` convention.
