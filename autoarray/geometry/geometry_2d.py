        A 2D geometry, representing a uniform rectangular grid of (y,x) coordinates which has ``shape_native``.

        pixel_scales
            The (y,x) scaled units to pixel units conversion factors of every pixel. If this is input as a `float`,
            it is converted to a (float, float) structure.
