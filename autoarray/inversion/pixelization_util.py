def rectangular_neighbors_from(shape_native: (int, int)) -> (np.ndarray, np.ndarray):
    """
    Returns the 4 adjacent neighbors of every pixel on a rectangular array or grid as an ndarray of shape
    [total_pixels, 4], using the uniformity of the rectangular grid's geometry to speed up the computation.

    Entries with values of ``-1`` signify edge pixels which do not have 4 neighbors. This function therefore also
    returns an ndarray of with the number of neighbors of every pixel, so when the neighbors are used the code knows
    how many neighbors to iterate over.

    Indexing is defined from the top-left corner rightwards and downwards, whereby the top-left pixel on the 2D array
    corresponds to index 0, the pixel to its right pixel 1, and so on.

    For example, on a 3x3 grid:

    - Pixel 0 is at the top-left and has two neighbors, the pixel to its right  (with index 1) and the  pixel below
    it (with index 3). Therefore, the pixel_neighbors[0,:] = [1, 3, -1, -1] and pixel_neighbors_size[0] = 2.

    - Pixel 1 is at the top-middle and has three neighbors, to its left (index 0, right (index 2) and below it
    (index 4). Therefore, pixel_neighbors[1,:] = [0, 2, 4, 1] and pixel_neighbors_size[1] = 3.

    - For pixel 4, the central pixel, pixel_neighbors[4,:] = [1, 3, 5, 7] and pixel_neighbors_size[4] = 4.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape_native : (int, int)
        The shape of the rectangular 2D array or grid which the pixels are defined on.

    Returns
    -------
    (np.ndarray, np.ndarray)
        The arrays containing the 1D index of every pixel's neighbors and the number of neighbors that each pixel has.
