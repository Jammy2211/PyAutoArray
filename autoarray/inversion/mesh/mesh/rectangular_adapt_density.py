    Creates a `Grid2DRecntagular` by overlaying the rectangular pixelization over an input grid of (y,x)
    coordinates.

    This is performed by first computing the minimum and maximum y and x coordinates of the input grid. A
    rectangular pixelization with dimensions `shape_native` is then laid over the grid using these coordinates,
    such that the extreme edges of this rectangular pixelization overlap these maximum and minimum (y,x) coordinates.

    spacing beyond these maximum and minimum coordinates.

class RectangularAdaptDensity(AbstractMesh):

        """
        A uniform rectangular mesh of pixels used to reconstruct a source on a
        regular grid.

        The mesh is defined by a 2D shape `(total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels)` and
        is indexed in row-major order:

            - Index 0 corresponds to the top-left pixel.
            - Indices increase from left to right across each row,
              and from top to bottom across rows.

        Each source-plane coordinate is associated with the rectangular pixel
        in which it lies. No interpolation is performed — every coordinate
        contributes entirely to a single pixel.

        Adaptive behaviour
        ------------------
        Although the rectangular mesh has a fixed, uniform geometry, it adapts
        *implicitly* to the spatial density of the points it is paired with.
        Regions of the source plane where many coordinates map onto the same
        pixel receive stronger observational constraints, while sparsely
        sampled regions are more weakly constrained.

        In gravitational lensing applications, this naturally concentrates
        information in regions of high magnification, where many image-plane
        pixels map to a small area of the source plane. The inversion therefore
        achieves higher effective resolution in these regions without requiring
        explicit refinement of the mesh geometry.

        Edge handling
        -------------
        Boundary (edge) pixels are automatically identified through the mesh
        neighbour structure. These edge pixels may be internally excluded
        (zeroed) during inversion to improve numerical stability and reduce
        edge artefacts. This zeroing is determined by the mesh connectivity
        and does not require manual specification of boundary indices.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : Tuple[int, int]
            The 2D dimensions of the rectangular pixel grid
            `(total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels)`.

        Raises
        ------
        MeshException
            If either dimension is less than 3, as a minimum of 3×3 pixels
            is required to define interior and boundary structure.

           grid's (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

        2) Determine the (y,x) coordinates of the pixelization's rectangular pixels, by laying this rectangular grid
