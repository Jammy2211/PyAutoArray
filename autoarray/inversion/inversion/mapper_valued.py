        """
        Pairs a `Mapper` object with an array of values (e.g. the `reconstruction` values of each value of each
        mapper pixel) in order to perform calculations which use both the `Mapper` and these values.

        For example, a common use case is to interpolate the reconstruction of values on a mapper from the
        mesh of the mapper (e.g. a Voronoi mesh) to a uniform Cartesian grid of values, because the irregular mesh
        is difficult to plot and analyze.

        This class also provides functionality to compute the magnification of the reconstruction, by comparing the
        sum of the values on the mapper in both the image and source planes, which is a specific quantity
        used in gravitational lensing.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mapper
            The `Mapper` object which pairs with the values, for example a `MapperVoronoi` object.
        values
            The values of each pixel of the mapper, which could be the `reconstruction` values of an `Inversion`,
            but alternatively could be other quantities such as the noise-map of these values.
        mesh_pixel_mask
            The mask of pixels that are omitted from the reconstruction when computing the image, for example to
            remove pixels with low signal-to-noise so they do not impact the magnification calculation.

        """
        Applies the `mesh_pixel_mask` to the values, setting all masked pixels to 0.0, so that mesh pixels
        can be removed to prevent them from impacting calculations.

        For example, the magnification calculation uses the values of the reconstruction to compute the magnification,
        but this can be impacted by pixels with low signal-to-noise. The `mesh_pixel_mask` can be used to remove
        these pixels from the calculation.

        The values of the mapper with the `mesh_pixel_mask` applied.

        """
        The values of a mapper can be on an irregular pixelization (e.g. a Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi mesh).

        Analysing the reconstruction can therefore be difficult and require specific functionality tailored to using
        this irregular grid.

        This function therefore interpolates the irregular reconstruction on to a regular grid of square pixels.
        The routine that performs the interpolation is specific to each pixelization and contained in its
        corresponding `Mapper`` objects, which are called by this function.

        The output interpolated reconstruction cis by default returned on a grid of 401 x 401 square pixels. This
        can be customized by changing the `shape_native` input, and a rectangular grid with rectangular pixels can
        be returned by instead inputting the optional `shape_scaled` tuple.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape_native
            The 2D shape in pixels of the interpolated reconstruction, which is always returned using square pixels.
        extent
            The (x0, x1, y0, y1) extent of the grid in scaled coordinates over which the grid is created if it
            is input.

        Returns a list of lists of the maximum cell or pixel values in the mapper.

        Neighbors can be filtered such that each maximum value in a pixel is higher than all surrounding pixels,
        thus forming a `peak` in the mapper values.

        For example, if a `reconstruction` is the mapper values and neighbor filtering is on, this would return the
        brightest pixels in the mapper reconstruction which are brighter than all pixels around them.

        In gravitational lensing, these peaks are the brightest regions of the source reconstruction and correspond
        to features like the centre of the source galaxy and knots of star formation in a galaxy.

        In the image-plane, this is computed by mapping the reconstruction to the image, summing all reconstructed

        This calculatiion is generally more robust that using an interpolated
