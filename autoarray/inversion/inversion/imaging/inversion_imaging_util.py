    The matrix w_tilde is a matrix of dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] that encodes the PSF convolution of
    every pair of image pixels given the noise map. This can be used to efficiently compute the curvature matrix via
    the mappings between image and source pixels, in a way that omits having to perform the PSF convolution on every
    individual source pixel. This provides a significant speed up for inversions of imaging datasets.

    When w_tilde is used to perform an inversion, the mapping matrices are not computed, meaning that they cannot be
    used to compute the data vector. This method creates the vector `w_tilde_data` which allows for the data
    vector to be computed efficiently without the mapping matrix.

    The matrix w_tilde_data is dimensions [image_pixels] and encodes the PSF convolution with the `weight_map`,
    where the weights are the image-pixel values divided by the noise-map values squared:

    weight = image / noise**2.0

    """
    The matrix `w_tilde_curvature` is a matrix of dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] that encodes the PSF
    convolution of every pair of image pixels on the noise map. This can be used to efficiently compute the
    curvature matrix via the mappings between image and source pixels, in a way that omits having to repeat the PSF
    convolution on every individual source pixel. This provides a significant speed up for inversions of imaging
    datasets.

    The limitation of this matrix is that the dimensions of [image_pixels, image_pixels] can exceed many 10s of GB's,
    making it impossible to store in memory and its use in linear algebra calculations slow. This methods creates
    a sparse matrix that can compute the matrix `w_tilde_curvature` efficiently, albeit the linear algebra calculations
    in PyAutoArray bypass this matrix entirely to go straight to the curvature matrix.

    for dataset data, w_tilde is a sparse matrix, whereby non-zero entries are only contained for pairs of image pixels
    where the two pixels overlap due to the kernel size. For example, if the kernel size is (11, 11) and two image
    pixels are separated by more than 20 pixels, the kernel will never convolve flux between the two pixels. Two image
    pixels will only share a convolution if they are within `kernel_overlap_size = 2 * kernel_shape - 1` pixels within
    one another.

    Thus, a `w_tilde_curvature_preload` matrix of dimensions [image_pixels, kernel_overlap_size ** 2] can be computed
    which significantly reduces the memory consumption by removing the sparsity. Because the dimensions of the second
    axes is no longer `image_pixels`, a second matrix `w_tilde_indexes` must also be computed containing the slim image
    pixel indexes of every entry of `w_tilde_preload`.

    In order for the preload to store half the number of values, owing to the symmetry of the `w_tilde_curvature`
    matrix, the image pixel pairs corresponding to the same image pixel are divided by two. This ensures that when the
    curvature matrix is computed these pixels are not double-counted.

    The values stored in `w_tilde_curvature_preload` represent the convolution of overlapping noise-maps given the
    PSF kernel. It is common for many values to be neglibly small. Removing these values can speed up the inversion
    and reduce memory at the expense of a numerically irrelevent change of solution.

    This matrix can then be used to compute the `curvature_matrix` in a memory efficient way that exploits the sparsity
    of the linear algebra.

    """
    Compute the value of an entry of the `w_tilde_curvature` matrix, where this entry encodes the PSF convolution of
    the noise-map between two image pixels.

    The calculation is performed by over-laying the PSF kernel over two noise-map pixels in 2D. For all pixels where
    the two overlaid PSF kernels overlap, the following calculation is performed for every noise map value:

    `value = kernel_value_0 * kernel_value_1 * (1.0 / noise_value) ** 2.0`

    This calculation infers the fraction of flux that every PSF convolution will move between each pair of noise-map
    pixels and can therefore be used to efficiently calculate the curvature_matrix that is used in the linear algebra
    calculation of an inversion.

    To compute the curvature matrix via w_tilde the following matrix multiplication is normally performed:

    curvature_matrix = mapping_matrix.T * w_tilde * mapping matrix

    This function speeds this calculation up in two ways:

    1) Instead of using `w_tilde` (dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] it uses `w_tilde_preload` (dimensions
    [image_pixels, kernel_overlap]). The massive reduction in the size of this matrix in memory allows for much fast
    computation.

    2) It omits the `mapping_matrix` and instead uses directly the 1D vector that maps every image pixel to a source
    pixel `native_index_for_slim_index`. This exploits the sparsity in the `mapping_matrix` to directly
    compute the `curvature_matrix` (e.g. it condenses the triple matrix multiplication into a double for loop!).

    Parameters

    curvature_indexes

        the weights of the data values when computing the curvature matrix.
    curvature_lengths

        curvature matrix.
    data_to_pix_unique
        An array that maps every data pixel index (e.g. the masked image pixel indexes in 1D) to its unique set of

    data_weights

    """
    Returns the off diagonal terms in the curvature matrix `F` (see Warren & Dye 2003) by computing them
    using `w_tilde_preload` (see `w_tilde_preload_interferometer_from`) for an imaging inversion.

    When there is more than one mapper in the inversion, its `mapping_matrix` is extended to have dimensions
    [data_pixels, sum(source_pixels_in_each_mapper)]. The curvature matrix therefore will have dimensions
    [sum(source_pixels_in_each_mapper), sum(source_pixels_in_each_mapper)].

    To compute the curvature matrix via w_tilde the following matrix multiplication is normally performed:

    curvature_matrix = mapping_matrix.T * w_tilde * mapping matrix

    When the `mapping_matrix` consists of multiple mappers from different planes, this means that shared data mappings
    between source-pixels in different mappers must be accounted for when computing the `curvature_matrix`. These
    appear as off-diagonal terms in the overall curvature matrix.

    This function evaluates these off-diagonal terms, by using the w-tilde curvature preloads and the unique
    data-to-pixelization mappings of each mapper. It behaves analogous to the
    function `curvature_matrix_via_w_tilde_curvature_preload_imaging_from`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    curvature_preload
        A matrix that precomputes the values for fast computation of the curvature matrix in a memory efficient way.
    curvature_indexes
        The image-pixel indexes of the values stored in the w tilde preload matrix, which are used to compute
        the weights of the data values when computing the curvature matrix.
    curvature_lengths
        The number of image pixels in every row of `w_tilde_curvature`, which is iterated over when computing the
        curvature matrix.
    data_to_pix_unique
        An array that maps every data pixel index (e.g. the masked image pixel indexes in 1D) to its unique set of
        pixelization pixel indexes (see `data_slim_to_pixelization_unique_from`).
    data_weights
        For every unique mapping between a set of data sub-pixels and a pixelization pixel, the weight of these mapping
        based on the number of sub-pixels that map to pixelization pixel.
    pix_lengths
        A 1D array describing how many unique pixels each data pixel maps too, which is used to iterate over
        `data_to_pix_unique` and `data_weights`.
    pix_pixels
        The total number of pixels in the pixelization that reconstructs the data.

    """
    Returns a matrix that for each data pixel, maps it to the sum of the values of a linear object function convolved
    with the PSF kernel at the data pixel.

    If a linear function in an inversion is fixed, its values can be evaluated and preloaded beforehand. For every
    data pixel, the PSF convolution with this preloaded linear function can also be preloaded, in a matrix of
    shape [data_pixels, 1].

    Given that multiple linear functions can be used and fixed in an inversion, this matrix is extended to have
    dimensions [data_pixels, total_fixed_linear_functions].

    When mapper objects and linear functions are used simultaneously in an inversion, this preloaded matrix
    significantly speed up the computation of their off-diagonal terms in the curvature matrix.

    This is similar to the preloading performed via the w-tilde formalism, except that there it is the PSF convolved
    values of each noise-map value pair that are preloaded.

    In **PyAutoGalaxy** and **PyAutoLens**, this preload is used when linear light profiles are fixed in the model.
    For example, when using a multi Gaussian expansion, the values defining how those Gaussians are evaluated
    (e.g. `centre`, `ell_comps` and `sigma`) are often fixed in a model, meaning this matrix can be preloaded and
    used for speed up.

    Parameters
    ----------

        The operated values of each linear function divided by the noise-map squared, in a matrix of shape

    Returns the off diagonal terms in the curvature matrix `F` (see Warren & Dye 2003) between a mapper object

    This takes as input the curvature weights of the linear function object, which are the values of the linear
    function convolved with the PSF and divided by the noise-map squared.

    For each unique mapping between a data pixel and a pixelization pixel, the pixels which that pixel convolves
    light into are computed, multiplied by their corresponding curvature weights and summed. This process also
    accounts the sub-pixel mapping of each data pixel to the pixelization pixel
