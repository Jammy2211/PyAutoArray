        """
        Regularization which uses the neighbors of the mesh (e.g. shared Voronoi vertexes) and values adaptred to the
        data being fitted to smooth an inversion's solution.

        For the weighted regularization scheme, each pixel is given an 'effective regularization weight', which is
        applied when each set of pixel neighbors are regularized with one another. The motivation of this is that
        different regions of a pixelization's mesh require different levels of regularization (e.g., high smoothing where the
        no signal is present and less smoothing where it is, see (Nightingale, Dye and Massey 2018)).

        Unlike ``Constant`` regularization, neighboring pixels must now be regularized with one another
        in both directions (e.g. if pixel 0 regularizes pixel 1, pixel 1 must also regularize pixel 0). For example:

        B = [-1, 1]  [0->1]
            [-1, -1]  1 now also regularizes 0

        For ``Constant`` regularization this would NOT produce a positive-definite matrix. However, for
        the weighted scheme, it does!

        The regularize weight_list change the B matrix as shown below - we simply multiply each pixel's effective
        regularization weight by each row of B it has a -1 in, so:

        regularization_weights = [1, 2, 3, 4]

        B = [-1, 1, 0 ,0] # [0->1]
            [0, -2, 2 ,0] # [1->2]
            [0, 0, -3 ,3] # [2->3]
            [4, 0, 0 ,-4] # [3->0]

        If our -1's werent down the diagonal this would look like:

        B = [4, 0, 0 ,-4] # [3->0]
            [0, -2, 2 ,0] # [1->2]
            [-1, 1, 0 ,0] # [0->1]
            [0, 0, -3 ,3] # [2->3] This is valid!

        A full description of regularization and this matrix can be found in the parent `AbstractRegularization` class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        coefficients
            The regularization coefficients which controls the degree of smoothing of the inversion reconstruction in
            high and low signal regions of the reconstruction.
        signal_scale
            A factor which controls how rapidly the smoothness of regularization varies from high signal regions to
            low signal regions.
