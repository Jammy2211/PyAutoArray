    """
    Returns the regularization weights for the adaptive regularization scheme (e.g. ``AdaptiveBrightness``).

    The weights define the effective regularization coefficient of every mesh parameter (typically pixels
    of a ``Mapper``).

    They are computed using an estimate of the expected signal in each pixel.

    Two regularization coefficients are used, corresponding to the:

    1) pixel_signals: pixels with a high pixel-signal (i.e. where the signal is located in the pixelization).
    2) 1.0 - pixel_signals: pixels with a low pixel-signal (i.e. where the signal is not located in the pixelization).

    Parameters
    ----------
    inner_coefficient
        The inner regularization coefficients which controls the degree of smoothing of the inversion reconstruction
        in the inner regions of a mesh's reconstruction.
    outer_coefficient
        The outer regularization coefficients which controls the degree of smoothing of the inversion reconstruction
        in the outer regions of a mesh's reconstruction.
    pixel_signals
        The estimated signal in every pixelization pixel, used to change the regularization weighting of high signal
        and low signal pixelizations.

    Returns
    -------
    jnp.ndarray
        The adaptive regularization weights which act as the effective regularization coefficients of
        every source pixel.

def weighted_regularization_matrix_from(
    regularization_weights: jnp.ndarray,
    neighbors: jnp.ndarray,
) -> jnp.ndarray:
    """
    Returns the regularization matrix of the adaptive regularization scheme (e.g. ``AdaptiveBrightness``).

    This matrix is computed using the regularization weights of every mesh pixel, which are computed using the
    function ``adaptive_regularization_weights_from``. These act as the effective regularization coefficients of
    every mesh pixel.

    The regularization matrix is computed using the pixel-neighbors array, which is setup using the appropriate
    neighbor calculation of the corresponding ``Mapper`` class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    regularization_weights
        The regularization weight of each pixel, adaptively governing the degree of gradient regularization
        applied to each inversion parameter (e.g. mesh pixels of a ``Mapper``).
    neighbors
        An array of length (total_pixels) which provides the index of all neighbors of every pixel in
        the mesh grid (entries of -1 correspond to no neighbor).
    neighbors_sizes
        An array of length (total_pixels) which gives the number of neighbors of every pixel in the
        Voronoi grid.

    Returns
    -------
    jnp.ndarray
        The regularization matrix computed using an adaptive regularization scheme where the effective regularization
        coefficient of every source pixel is different.

        """
        Regularization which uses the neighbors of the mesh (e.g. shared Voronoi vertexes) and values adaptred to the
        data being fitted to smooth an inversion's solution.

        For the weighted regularization scheme, each pixel is given an 'effective regularization weight', which is
        applied when each set of pixel neighbors are regularized with one another. The motivation of this is that
        different regions of a pixelization's mesh require different levels of regularization (e.g., high smoothing where the
        no signal is present and less smoothing where it is, see (Nightingale, Dye and Massey 2018)).

        Unlike ``Constant`` regularization, neighboring pixels must now be regularized with one another
        in both directions (e.g. if pixel 0 regularizes pixel 1, pixel 1 must also regularize pixel 0). For example:

        B = [-1, 1]  [0->1]
            [-1, -1]  1 now also regularizes 0

        For ``Constant`` regularization this would NOT produce a positive-definite matrix. However, for
        the weighted scheme, it does!

        The regularize weight_list change the B matrix as shown below - we simply multiply each pixel's effective
        regularization weight by each row of B it has a -1 in, so:

        regularization_weights = [1, 2, 3, 4]

        B = [-1, 1, 0 ,0] # [0->1]
            [0, -2, 2 ,0] # [1->2]
            [0, 0, -3 ,3] # [2->3]
            [4, 0, 0 ,-4] # [3->0]

        If our -1's werent down the diagonal this would look like:

        B = [4, 0, 0 ,-4] # [3->0]
            [0, -2, 2 ,0] # [1->2]
            [-1, 1, 0 ,0] # [0->1]
            [0, 0, -3 ,3] # [2->3] This is valid!

        A full description of regularization and this matrix can be found in the parent `AbstractRegularization` class.
