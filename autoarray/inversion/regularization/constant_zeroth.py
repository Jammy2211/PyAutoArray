    From the pixel-neighbors array, setup the regularization matrix using the instance regularization scheme.

    A complete description of regularizatin and the ``regularization_matrix`` can be found in the ``Regularization``
    class in the module ``autoarray.inversion.regularization``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coefficients
        The regularization coefficients which controls the degree of smoothing of the inversion reconstruction.
    neighbors
        An array of length (total_pixels) which provides the index of all neighbors of every pixel in
        the Voronoi grid (entries of -1 correspond to no neighbor).
    neighbors_sizes
        An array of length (total_pixels) which gives the number of neighbors of every pixel in the
        Voronoi grid.

    Returns
    -------

        coefficient of every source pixel is the same.
