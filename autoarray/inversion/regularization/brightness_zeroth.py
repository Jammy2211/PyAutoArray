    Returns the regularization weights for the brightness zeroth regularization scheme (e.g. ``BrightnessZeroth``).

    They are computed using an estimate of the expected signal in each pixel.

    The zeroth order regularization coefficients is applied in combination with  1.0 - pixel_signals, which are

    Parameters
    ----------
    coefficient
        The level of zeroth order regularization applied to every mesh parameter (typically pixels of a ``Mapper``),
        with the degree applied varying based on the ``pixel_signals``.
    pixel_signals
        The estimated signal in every pixelization pixel, used to change the regularization weighting of high signal
        and low signal pixelizations.

    Returns
    -------
    jnp.ndarray
        The zeroth order regularization weights which act as the effective level of zeroth order regularization
        applied to every mesh parameter.

        """
        An adaptive regularization scheme which applies zeroth order regularization to pixels with low expected
        signal values.

        For the weighted regularization scheme, each pixel is given an 'effective regularization weight', which is
        controls the degree of zeroth order regularization applied to each pixel. The motivation of this is that
        the exterior regions different regions of a pixelization's mesh ought to have a signal consistent with zero,
        but may have a low level of non-zero signal when fitting the data.

        To implement this regularization, values on the diagonal of the regularization matrix are increased
        according to the regularization weight_list of each pixel.

        A full description of regularization and this matrix can be found in the parent `AbstractRegularization` class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        coefficient
            The regularization coefficient which controls the degree of zeroth order regularizaiton applied to
            the inversion reconstruction, in regions of low signal.
        signal_scale
            A factor which controls how rapidly the smoothness of regularization varies from high signal regions to
            low signal regions.
