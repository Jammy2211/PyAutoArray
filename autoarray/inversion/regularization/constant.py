class Constant(AbstractRegularization):

        """
        Regularization which uses the neighbors of the mesh (e.g. shared Voronoi vertexes) and
        a single value to smooth an inversion's solution.

        For this regularization scheme, there is only 1 regularization coefficient that is applied to
        all neighboring pixels / parameters. This means that the matrix B only needs to regularize pixels / parameters
        in one direction (e.g. pixel 0 regularizes pixel 1, but NOT visa versa). For example:

        B = [-1, 1]  [0->1]
            [0, -1]  1 does not regularization with 0

        A small numerical value of 1.0e-8 is added to all elements in constant regularization matrix, to ensure that
        it is positive definite.

        A full description of regularization and this matrix can be found in the parent `AbstractRegularization` class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        coefficient
            The regularization coefficient which controls the degree of smooth of the inversion reconstruction.

        Returns the regularization weights of this regularization scheme.

        The regularization weights define the level of regularization applied to each parameter in the linear object
        (e.g. the ``pixels`` in a ``Mapper``).

        For standard regularization (e.g. ``Constant``) are weights are equal, however for adaptive schemes
        (e.g. ``AdaptiveBrightness``) they vary to adapt to the data being reconstructed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        linear_obj
            The linear object (e.g. a ``Mapper``) which uses these weights when performing regularization.
