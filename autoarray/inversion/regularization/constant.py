    neighbors : ndarray, shape (S, P), dtype=int64
        An array of length (total_pixels) which provides the index of all neighbors of every pixel in
        the Voronoi grid (entries of -1 correspond to no neighbor).
    neighbors_sizes : ndarray, shape (S,), dtype=int64

        """
        Regularization which uses the neighbors of the mesh (e.g. shared Voronoi vertexes) and
        a single value to smooth an inversion's solution.

        For this regularization scheme, there is only 1 regularization coefficient that is applied to
        all neighboring pixels / parameters. This means that the matrix B only needs to regularize pixels / parameters
        in one direction (e.g. pixel 0 regularizes pixel 1, but NOT visa versa). For example:

        B = [-1, 1]  [0->1]
            [0, -1]  1 does not regularization with 0

        A small numerical value of 1.0e-8 is added to all elements in constant regularization matrix, to ensure that
        it is positive definite.

        A full description of regularization and this matrix can be found in the parent `AbstractRegularization` class.

        For standard regularization (e.g. ``Constant``) are weights are equal, however for adaptive schemes
        (e.g. ``AdaptiveBrightness``) they vary to adapt to the data being reconstructed.
