        Pairs a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates with a 2D mesh, which can be combined with a ``Regularization``
        scheme in order to reconstruct data via an ``Inversion``.

        **Image-Plane Example**

        For the simplest case, we have a 2D image whose pixel centres are defined on a (y,x) grid of Cartesian
        coordinates, which are paired with the ``Mesh`` of the ``Pixelization``:

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_image_plane/data_image_plane.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_image_plane/grid_image_plane.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_image_plane/image_plane_mesh.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        The visual above shows:

        - **Left:** Observed image of a galaxy.
        - **Centre:** The (y,x) grid of coordinates corresponding to the centre of each pixel in the observed image.
          The centre of each pixel is shown by a magenta point.
        - **Right:** An overlaid ``Rectangular`` ``mesh``, where the square pixel boundaries of this mesh are shown by
          dashed black lines.

        Red points highlight a subset of points. They are used below to illustrate additional behaviour
        of ``Pixelization``'s.

        The **centre** and **right** panels show the core functionality of a ``Pixelization``. It represents the
        mappings between an image's (y,x) grid of coordinates and a ``Mesh``'s (y,x) grid of coordinates (in the
        example above the centres of ``Rectangular`` pixels, shown by the dashed black lines).


        **Image-Plane Example (Masked)**

        The mappings above are shown for a 2D image which was not been masked.

        The images below use the same image, which has had a 2.5" circular mask applied to it:

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_masked_image_plane/data_image_plane.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_masked_image_plane/grid_image_plane.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_masked_image_plane/image_plane_mesh.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        The behaviour is analogous to the non-masked case, however only unmasked pixel's in the image's (y,x) grid
        of coordinates are included when pairing with the ``Rectangular`` mesh.


        **Source-Plane Example (Masked)**

        In **PyAutoGalaxy** the above two cases are representative of how ``Pixelization`` objects are used.

        In the strong lensing package **PyAutoLens**, gravitational lensing deflects the observed image's (y,x)
        grid of coordinates and the ``mesh`` is overlaid in the source-plane:

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_masked_source_plane/data_image_plane.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_masked_source_plane/grid_image_plane.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        .. image:: https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy/blob/main/docs/api/images/pixelization_masked_source_plane/source_plane_mesh.png?raw=true
          :width: 240

        The red points, highlighted throughout all visuals above, show that after gravitational lensing the points
        change position from the image-plane to source-plane.


        **Pixelization Uses**

        The following objects / packages are used with a ``Pixelization``:

        - ``Mapper``: Computes the mappings between the image's (y,x) grid and the mesh's pixels.
        - ``Inversion``: Use the ``Pixelization`` to reconstruct the data on the mesh via linear algebra.
        - ``Regularization``: Apply smoothing to the solutions computed using an ``Inversion``.

        In the example above, a ``Rectangular`` ``Mesh`` object is used. Other meshes are available (e.g.
        ``Delaunay``, ``Voronoi``).

        **Source Code API**

        The ``Pixelization`` API uses the following terms for the grids shown above:

        - ``image_plane_data_grid``: The observed data grid in the image-plane (which is paired with the mesh).
        - ``image_plane_mesh_grid``: The (y,x) centers of the mesh pixels in the image-plane.
        - ``source_plane_data_grid``: The observed data grid mapped to the source-plane after gravitational lensing.
        - ``source_plane_mesh_grid``: The (y,x) centers of the mesh pixels mapped to the source-plane after gravitational lensing.

        If a transformation of coordinates is not applied (e.g. no gravitational lensing), the ``image_plane``
        and ``source_plane`` grids are identical (this is the case in **PyAutoGalaxy**).

        Parameters
        ----------
        mesh
            The mesh object (e.g. Rectangular grid of pixels, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi mesh) describing the
            pixels of the `Pixelization`.
        regularization
            The regularization object that can smooth ``Pixelization`` pixels with one another when it is used to
            reconstruct data via an `Inversion`.
        image_mesh
            The grid of mesh coordinates may be derived from the image, for example if the pixelization is adaptive.
            This object controls how this mesh is computed.
