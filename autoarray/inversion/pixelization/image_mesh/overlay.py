        """
        Computes an image-mesh by overlaying a uniform grid of (y,x) coordinates over the masked image that the
        pixelization is fitting.

        For example, the masked image data may consist of a 2D annular region. This image mesh class determines
        the image-mesh grid as follows:

        1) Overlay a uniform grid of dimensions `shape` over the annular mask, covering its four extreme (y,x)
        coordinates (e.g. max(x), min(x), max(y), min(y)).

        2) Find all pixels in the overlaid uniform grid which are contained within the annular mask, discarding
        all other pixels.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape
            The 2D shape of the grid which is overlaid over the grid to determine the image mesh.
