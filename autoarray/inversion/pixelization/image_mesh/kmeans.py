        """
        Computes an image-mesh by running a weighted KMeans clustering algorithm.

        This requires an adapt-image, which is the image that the KMeans algorithm adapts to in order to compute the
        image mesh. This could simply be the image itself, or a model fit to the image which removes certain
        features or noise.

        For example, using the adapt image, the image mesh is computed as follows:

        1) Convert the adapt image to a weight map, which is a 2D array of weight values.

        2) Run the KMeans algorithm on the weight map, such that the image mesh pixels cluster around the weight map
        values with higher values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        total_pixels
            The total number of pixels in the image mesh and input into the KMeans algortihm.

            adapts to.

                The number of pixels passed to the KMeans object exceeds the number of image-pixels in the mask of
                the data being fitted. This is not allowed by the KMenas algorithm and will cause an error.
                
                To fix this, you should reduce the number of pixels in the KMeans object to be less than the number
                of image-pixels in the mask of the data being fitted.
                
                If you are performing model-fitting, you should update the priors to have an upper limit which does
                not exceed the number of image-pixels in the mask of the data being fitted.
                
                For adaptive fitting, the KMeans object has been superseeded by the Hilbert object, which does not
                have this limitation and performs better in general. You should therefore consider using the Hilbert
                object instead.
