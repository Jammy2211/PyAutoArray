        Returns an array containing the number of mesh pixels in every pixel of the data's mask.

        For example, image-mesh adaption may be performed on a 3.0" circular mask of data. The high weight pixels
        may have 3 or more mesh pixels per image pixel, whereas low weight regions may have zero pixels. The array
        returned by this function gives the integer number of pixels in each data pixel.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mask
            The mask of the dataset being analysed, which the pixelization grid maps too. The number of
            mesh pixels mapped inside each of this mask's image-pixels is returned.
        mesh_grid
            The image mesh-grid computed by the class which adapts to the data's mask. The number of image mesh pixels
            that fall within each of the data's mask pixels is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        An array containing the integer number of image-mesh pixels that fall without each of the data's mask.
