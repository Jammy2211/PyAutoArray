        """
        Computes an image-mesh by computing the Hilbert curve of the adapt data and drawing points from it.

        This requires an adapt-image, which is the image that the Hilbert curve algorithm adapts to in order to compute
        the image mesh. This could simply be the image itself, or a model fit to the image which removes certain
        features or noise.

        For example, using the adapt image, the image mesh is computed as follows:

        1) Convert the adapt image to a weight map, which is a 2D array of weight values.

        2) Run the Hilbert algorithm on the weight map, such that the image mesh pixels cluster around the weight map
        values with higher values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels
            The total number of pixels in the image mesh and drawn from the Hilbert curve.
        weight_floor
            The minimum weight value in the weight map, which allows more pixels to be drawn from the lower weight
            regions of the adapt image.
        weight_power
            The power the weight values are raised too, which allows more pixels to be drawn from the higher weight
            regions of the adapt image.

        image_mesh_min_mesh_pixels_per_pixel
            If not None, the image-mesh must place this many mesh pixels per image pixels in the N highest weighted
            regions of the adapt data, or an `InversionException` is raised. This can be used to force the image-mesh
            to cluster large numbers of source pixels to the adapt-datas brightest regions.
        image_mesh_min_mesh_number
            The value N given above in the docstring for `image_mesh_min_mesh_pixels_per_pixel`, indicating how many
            image pixels are checked for having a threshold number of mesh pixels.
        image_mesh_adapt_background_percent_threshold
            If not None, the image-mesh must place this percentage of mesh-pixels in the background regions of the
            `adapt_data`, where the background is the `image_mesh_adapt_background_percent_check` masked data pixels
            with the lowest values.
        image_mesh_adapt_background_percent_check
            The percentage of masked data pixels which are checked for the background criteria.

        Checks the number of mesh pixels in every image pixel and raises an `InversionException` if there are fewer

        This allows a user to force a model-fit to use image-mesh's which cluster a large number of mesh pixels to
        the brightest regions of the image data (E.g. the highst weighted regions).

        The check works as follows:

        1) Compute the 2D array of the number of mesh pixels in every masked data image pixel.
        2) Find the number of mesh pixels in the N data pixels with the larger number of mesh pixels, where N is
           given by `image_mesh_min_mesh_number`. For example, if `image_mesh_min_mesh_number=5` then
           the number of mesh pixels in the 5 data pixels with the most data pixels is computed.
        3) Compare the lowest value above to the value `image_mesh_min_mesh_pixels_per_pixel`. If the value is
           below this value, raise an `InversionException`.

        Therefore, by settings `image_mesh_min_mesh_pixels_per_pixel` to a value above 1 the code is forced
        to adapt the image mesh enough to put many mesh pixels in the brightest image pixels.

        mesh_grid
            The image mesh-grid computed by the class which adapts to the data's mask. The number of image mesh pixels
            that fall within each of the data's mask pixels is returned.

        """
        Checks the number of mesh pixels in the background of the image-mesh and raises an `InversionException` if
        there are fewer mesh pixels in the background than the input settings.

        This allows a user to force a model-fit to use image-mesh's which cluster a minimum number of mesh pixels to
        the faintest regions of the image data (E.g. the lowest weighted regions). This prevents too few image-mesh
        pixels being allocated to the background of the data.

        The check works as follows:

        1) Find all pixels in the background of the `adapt_data`, which are N pixels with the lowest values, where N is
           a percentage given by `image_mesh_adapt_background_percent_check`. If N is 50%, then the half of
            pixels in `adapt_data` with the lowest values will be checked.
        2) Sum the total number of mesh pixels in these background pixels, thereby estimating the number of mesh pixels
            assigned to background pixels.
        3) Compare this value to the total number of mesh pixels multiplied
           by `image_mesh_adapt_background_percent_threshold` and raise an `InversionException` if the number
           of mesh pixels is below this value, meaning the background did not have sufficient mesh pixels in it.

        Therefore, by setting `image_mesh_adapt_background_percent_threshold` the code is forced
        to adapt the image mesh in a way that places many mesh pixels in the background regions.
