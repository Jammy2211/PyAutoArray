        The Delaunay mesh represents pixels as an irregular 2D grid of Delaunay triangles.

        The corners of the Delaunay pixels are derived in the image plane, by applying a KMeans clustering algorithm
        to the masked image data's weight-map. The ``weight_floor`` and ``weight_power`` allow the KMeans algorithm to

        mapped to the source-plane  via gravitational lensing, where they form the Delaunay pixel corners.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels
            The total number of pixels in the mesh, which is therefore also the number of (y,x) coordinates computed
            via the KMeans clustering algorithm in image-plane.
        weight_floor
            A parameter which reweights the data values the KMeans algorithm is applied too; as the floor increases
            more weight is applied to values with lower values thus allowing mesh pixels to be placed in these
            regions of the data.
