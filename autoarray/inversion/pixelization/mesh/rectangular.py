class Rectangular(AbstractMesh):
    def __init__(self, shape: Tuple[int, int] = (3, 3)):
        """
        A uniform mesh of rectangular pixels, which without interpolation are paired with a 2D grid of (y,x)
        coordinates.

        For a full description of how a mesh is paired with another grid,
        see the :meth:`Pixelization API documentation <autoarray.inversion.pixelization.pixelization.Pixelization>`.

        The rectangular grid is uniform, has dimensions (total_y_pixels, total_x_pixels) and has indexing beginning
        in the top-left corner and going rightwards and downwards.

        A ``Pixelization`` using a ``Rectangular`` mesh has three grids associated with it:

        - ``image_plane_data_grid``: The observed data grid in the image-plane (which is paired with the mesh in
          the source-plane).
        - ``source_plane_data_grid``: The observed data grid mapped to the source-plane after gravitational lensing.
        - ``source_plane_mesh_grid``: The centres of each rectangular pixel.

        It does not have a ``image_plane_mesh_grid`` because a rectangular pixelization is constructed by overlaying
        a grid of rectangular over the `source_plane_data_grid`.

        Each (y,x) coordinate in the `source_plane_data_grid` is associated with the rectangular pixelization pixel
        it falls within. No interpolation is performed when making these associations.
        Parameters
        ----------
        shape
            The 2D dimensions of the rectangular grid of pixels (total_y_pixels, total_x_pixel).

         Mapper objects describe the mappings between pixels in the masked 2D data and the pixels in a pixelization,
         in both the `data` and `source` frames.

         This function returns a `MapperRectangularNoInterp` as follows:

         1) If `relocate_pix_border=True`, the border of the input `source_plane_data_grid` is used to relocate all of the
            grid's (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

         2) Determine the (y,x) coordinates of the pixelization's rectangular pixels, by laying this rectangular grid
            over the 2D grid of relocated (y,x) coordinates computed in step 1 (or the input `source_plane_data_grid` if step 1
            is bypassed).

         3) Return the `MapperRectangularNoInterp`.

         Parameters
         ----------
         source_plane_data_grid
             A 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates associated with the unmasked 2D data after it has been transformed to the
             `source` reference frame.
         source_plane_mesh_grid
             Not used for a rectangular pixelization, because the pixelization grid in the `source` frame is computed
             by overlaying the `source_plane_data_grid` with the rectangular pixelization.
         image_plane_mesh_grid
             Not used for a rectangular pixelization.
         adapt_data
             Not used for a rectangular pixelization.
        relocate_pix_border
             If `True`, all coordinates of all pixelization source mesh grids have pixels outside their border
             relocated to their edge.
         preloads
             Object which may contain preloaded arrays of quantities computed in the pixelization, which are passed via
             this object speed up the calculation.
         run_time_dict
             A dictionary which contains timing of certain functions calls which is used for profiling.
