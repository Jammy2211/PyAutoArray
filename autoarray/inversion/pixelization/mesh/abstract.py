        Relocates all coordinates of the input `source_plane_data_grid` that are outside of a

        The border is determined from the mask of the 2D data in the `data` frame before any transformations of the
        data's grid are performed. The border is all pixels in this mask that are pixels at its extreme edge. These
        pixel indexes are used to then determine a grid of (y,x) coordinates from the transformed `source_grid_grid` in
        the `source` reference frame, whereby points located outside of it are relocated to the border's edge.

        A full description of relocation is given in the method grid_2d.relocated_grid_from()`.

        This is used in the project PyAutoLens to relocate the coordinates that are ray-traced near the centre of mass

        border_relocator

           edge.
        source_plane_data_grid
            A 2D (y,x) grid of coordinates, whose coordinates outside the border are relocated to its edge.

        Parameters
        ----------
        border_relocator
           The border relocator, which relocates coordinates outside the border of the source-plane data grid to its
           edge.
        source_plane_data_grid
            A 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates associated with the unmasked 2D data after it has been transformed to the
            `source` reference frame.
        source_plane_mesh_grid
            The centres of every Voronoi pixel in the `source` frame, which are initially derived by computing a sparse
            set of (y,x) coordinates computed from the unmasked data in the `data` frame and applying a transformation
            to this.
