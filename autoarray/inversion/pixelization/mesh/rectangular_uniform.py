        Parameters
        ----------
        source_plane_data_grid
            The (y,x) grid of coordinates over which the rectangular pixelization is overlaid, where this grid may have
            had exterior pixels relocated to its edge via the border.
        source_plane_mesh_grid
            Not used for a rectangular pixelization, because the pixelization grid in the `source` frame is computed
            by overlaying the `source_plane_data_grid` with the rectangular pixelization.
