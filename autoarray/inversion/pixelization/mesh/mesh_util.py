def rectangular_neighbors_from(
    shape_native: Tuple[int, int],
) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Returns the 4 (or less) adjacent neighbors of every pixel on a rectangular pixelization as an ndarray of shape
    [total_pixels, 4], called `neighbors`. This uses the uniformity of the rectangular grid's geometry to speed
    up the computation.

    Entries with values of `-1` signify edge pixels which do not have neighbors. This function therefore also returns
    an ndarray with the number of neighbors of every pixel, `neighbors_sizes`, which is iterated over when using
    the `neighbors` ndarray.

    Indexing is defined from the top-left corner rightwards and downwards, whereby the top-left pixel on the 2D array
    corresponds to index 0, the pixel to its right pixel 1, and so on.

    For example, on a 3x3 grid:

    - Pixel 0 is at the top-left and has two neighbors, the pixel to its right  (with index 1) and the pixel below
      it (with index 3). Therefore, the neighbors[0,:] = [1, 3, -1, -1] and neighbors_sizes[0] = 2.

    - Pixel 1 is at the top-middle and has three neighbors, to its left (index 0, right (index 2) and below it
      (index 4). Therefore, neighbors[1,:] = [0, 2, 4, -1] and neighbors_sizes[1] = 3.

    - For pixel 4, the central pixel, neighbors[4,:] = [1, 3, 5, 7] and neighbors_sizes[4] = 4.

    shape_native
