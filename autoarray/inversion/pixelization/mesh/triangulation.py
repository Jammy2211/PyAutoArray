        """
         Mapper objects describe the mappings between pixels in the masked 2D data and the pixels in a mesh,
         in both the `data` and `source` frames.

         This function returns a `MapperVoronoiNoInterp` as follows:

         1) Before this routine is called, a sparse grid of (y,x) coordinates are computed from the 2D masked data,
            the `image_plane_mesh_grid`, which acts as the Voronoi pixel centres of the mesh and mapper.

         2) Before this routine is called, operations are performed on this `image_plane_mesh_grid` that transform it
            from a 2D grid which overlaps with the 2D mask of the data in the `data` frame to an irregular grid in
            the `source` frame, the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.

         3) If `relocate_pix_border=True`, the border of the input `source_plane_data_grid` is used to relocate all of the
            grid's (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

         4) If `relocate_pix_border=True`, the border of the input `source_plane_data_grid` is used to relocate all of the
            transformed `source_plane_mesh_grid`'s (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

         5) Use the transformed `source_plane_mesh_grid`'s (y,x) coordinates as the centres of the Voronoi mesh.

         6) Return the `MapperVoronoiNoInterp`.

         Parameters
         ----------
         source_plane_data_grid
             A 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates associated with the unmasked 2D data after it has been transformed to the
             `source` reference frame.
         source_plane_mesh_grid
             The centres of every Voronoi pixel in the `source` frame, which are initially derived by computing a sparse
             set of (y,x) coordinates computed from the unmasked data in the `data` frame and applying a transformation
             to this.
         image_plane_mesh_grid
             The sparse set of (y,x) coordinates computed from the unmasked data in the `data` frame. This has a
             transformation applied to it to create the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.
         adapt_data
             Not used for a rectangular mesh.
        relocate_pix_border
             If `True`, all coordinates of all pixelization source mesh grids have pixels outside their border
             relocated to their edge.
         preloads
             Object which may contain preloaded arrays of quantities computed in the mesh, which are passed via
             this object speed up the calculation.
         run_time_dict
             A dictionary which contains timing of certain functions calls which is used for profiling.
