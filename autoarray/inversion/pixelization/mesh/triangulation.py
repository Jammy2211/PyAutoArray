        """
        Mapper objects describe the mappings between pixels in the masked 2D data and the pixels in a mesh,
        in both the `data` and `source` frames.

        This function returns a `MapperVoronoi` as follows:

        1) Before this routine is called, a sparse grid of (y,x) coordinates are computed from the 2D masked data,
           the `image_plane_mesh_grid`, which acts as the Voronoi pixel centres of the mesh and mapper.

        2) Before this routine is called, operations are performed on this `image_plane_mesh_grid` that transform it
           from a 2D grid which overlaps with the 2D mask of the data in the `data` frame to an irregular grid in
           the `source` frame, the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.

        3) If the border relocator is input, the border of the input `source_plane_data_grid` is used to relocate all of the
           grid's (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

        4) If the border relocatiro is input, the border of the input `source_plane_data_grid` is used to relocate all of the
           transformed `source_plane_mesh_grid`'s (y,x) coordinates beyond the border to the edge of the border.

        5) Use the transformed `source_plane_mesh_grid`'s (y,x) coordinates as the centres of the Voronoi mesh.

        6) Return the `MapperVoronoi`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        border_relocator
           The border relocator, which relocates coordinates outside the border of the source-plane data grid to its
           edge.
        source_plane_data_grid
            A 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates associated with the unmasked 2D data after it has been transformed to the
            `source` reference frame.
        source_plane_mesh_grid
            The centres of every Voronoi pixel in the `source` frame, which are initially derived by computing a sparse
            set of (y,x) coordinates computed from the unmasked data in the `data` frame and applying a transformation
            to this.
        image_plane_mesh_grid
            The sparse set of (y,x) coordinates computed from the unmasked data in the `data` frame. This has a
            transformation applied to it to create the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.
        adapt_data
            Not used for a rectangular mesh.
