        """
        Groups the different grids used by `Mesh` objects, the `mesh` package and the `pixelization` package, which
        create the following four grids:

        - `image_plane_data_grid`: the grid defining where data-points in frame of the data are.

        - `source_plane_data_grid`: the grid defining where the mapped coordinates of these data-points in the source-frame
         of the linear object are.

        - `image_plane_mesh_grid`: the grid defining where the linear object parameters (e.g. what are used as pixels of
        the mapper) are in the image-plane.

        - `source_plane_mesh_grid`: the grid defining where the mapped coordinates of the linear object parameters
        are in the source frame.

        Read the docstrings of the `mesh` package for more information is this is unclear.

         This grouped set of grids are input into  `Mapper` objects, in order to determine the mappings between the
         masked data grid's data points (`image_plane_data_grid` and `source_plane_data_grid`) and the mesh's pixels
         (`image_plane_mesh_grid` and `source_plane_mesh_grid`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        source_plane_data_grid
            A 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates associated with the unmasked 2D data after it has been transformed to the
            `source` reference frame.
        source_plane_mesh_grid
            The 2D grid of (y,x) centres of every pixelization pixel in the `source` frame.
        image_plane_mesh_grid
            The sparse set of (y,x) coordinates computed from the unmasked data in the `data` frame. This has a
            transformation applied to it to create the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.
        adapt_data
            An image which is used to determine the `image_plane_mesh_grid` and therefore adapt the distribution of
            pixels of the Delaunay grid to the data it discretizes.
        preloads
            Preloads in memory certain arrays which may be known beforehand in order to speed up the calculation,
            for example the `source_plane_mesh_grid` could be preloaded.
        run_time_dict
            A dictionary which contains timing of certain functions calls which is used for profiling.
