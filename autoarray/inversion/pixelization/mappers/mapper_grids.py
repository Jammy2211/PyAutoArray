        """
        Groups the different grids used by `Mesh` objects, the `mesh` package and the `pixelization` package, which
        create the following four grids:

        - `image_plane_data_grid`: the grid defining where data-points in frame of the data are.

        - `source_plane_data_grid`: the grid defining where the mapped coordinates of these data-points in the source-frame
         of the linear object are.

        - `image_plane_mesh_grid`: the grid defining where the linear object parameters (e.g. what are used as pixels of
        the mapper) are in the image-plane.

        - `source_plane_mesh_grid`: the grid defining where the mapped coordinates of the linear object parameters
        are in the source frame.

        Read the docstrings of the `mesh` package for more information is this is unclear.

         This grouped set of grids are input into  `Mapper` objects, in order to determine the mappings between the
         masked data grid's data points (`image_plane_data_grid` and `source_plane_data_grid`) and the mesh's pixels
         (`image_plane_mesh_grid` and `source_plane_mesh_grid`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        source_plane_data_grid
            A 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates associated with the unmasked 2D data after it has been transformed to the
            `source` reference frame.
        source_plane_mesh_grid
            The 2D grid of (y,x) centres of every pixelization pixel in the `source` frame.
        image_plane_mesh_grid
            The sparse set of (y,x) coordinates computed from the unmasked data in the `data` frame. This has a
            transformation applied to it to create the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.
        adapt_data
            An image which is used to determine the `image_plane_mesh_grid` and therefore adapt the distribution of
            pixels of the Delaunay grid to the data it discretizes.
        settings
            Settings controlling the pixelization for example if a border is used to relocate its exterior coordinates.
        preloads
            Preloads in memory certain arrays which may be known beforehand in order to speed up the calculation,
            for example the `source_plane_mesh_grid` could be preloaded.
        run_time_dict
            A dictionary which contains timing of certain functions calls which is used for profiling.
