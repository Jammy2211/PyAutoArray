    """
    Create an array describing the unique mappings between the sub-pixels of every slim data pixel and the pixelization
    pixels, which is used to perform efficiently linear algebra calculations.

    For example, assuming `sub_size=2`:

    - If 3 sub-pixels in image pixel 0 map to pixelization pixel 2 then `data_pix_to_unique[0, 0] = 2`.
    - If the fourth sub-pixel maps to pixelization pixel 4, then `data_to_pix_unique[0, 1] = 4`.

    The size of the second index depends on the number of unique sub-pixel to pixelization pixels mappings in a given
    data pixel. In the example above, there were only two unique sets of mapping, but for high levels of sub-gridding
    there could be many more unique mappings all of which must be stored.

    The array `data_to_pix_unique` does not describe how many sub-pixels uniquely map to each pixelization pixel for
    a given data pixel. This information is contained in the array `data_weights`. For the example above,
    where `sub_size=2` and therefore `sub_fraction=0.25`:

    - `data_weights[0, 0] = 0.75` (because 3 sub-pixels mapped to this pixelization pixel).
    - `data_weights[0, 1] = 0.25` (because 1 sub-pixel mapped to this pixelization pixel).

    The `sub_fractions` are stored as opposed to the number of sub-pixels, because these values are used directly
    when performing the linear algebra calculation.

    The array `pix_lengths` in a 1D array of dimensions [data_pixels] describing how many unique pixelization pixels
    each data pixel's set of sub-pixels maps too.

    pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index

    """
    Returns the (hyper) signal in each pixel, where the signal is the sum of its mapped data values.
    These pixel-signals are used to compute the effective regularization weight of each pixel.

    The pixel signals are computed as follows:

    1) Divide by the number of mappe data points in the pixel, to ensure all pixels have the same
       'relative' signal (i.e. a pixel with 10 pixels doesn't have x2 the signal of one with 5).

    2) Divided by the maximum pixel-signal, so that all signals vary between 0 and 1. This ensures that the
       regularization weight_list are defined identically for any data quantity or signal-to-noise_map ratio.

    3) Raised to the power of the hyper-parameter *signal_scale*, so the method can control the relative
       contribution regularization in different regions of pixelization.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pixels
        The total number of pixels in the pixelization the regularization scheme is applied to.
    signal_scale
        A factor which controls how rapidly the smoothness of regularization varies from high signal regions to
        low signal regions.
    regular_to_pix
        A 1D array util every pixel on the grid to a pixel on the pixelization.
    hyper_data
        The image of the galaxy which is used to compute the weigghted pixel signals.

    """
    Returns the mapping matrix, which is a matrix representing the mapping between every unmasked sub-pixel of the data
    and the pixels of a pixelization. Non-zero entries signify a mapping, whereas zeros signify no mapping.

    For example, if the data has 5 unmasked pixels (with `sub_size=1` so there are not sub-pixels) and the pixelization
    3 pixels, with the following mappings:

    data pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 0
    data pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 0
    data pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 4 -> pixelization pixel 2

    The mapping matrix (which is of dimensions [data_pixels, pixelization_pixels]) would appear as follows:

    [1, 0, 0] [0->0]
    [1, 0, 0] [1->0]
    [0, 1, 0] [2->1]
    [0, 1, 0] [3->1]
    [0, 0, 1] [4->2]

    The mapping matrix is actually built using the sub-grid of the grid, whereby each pixel is divided into a grid of
    sub-pixels which are all paired to pixels in the pixelization. The entries in the mapping matrix now become
    fractional values dependent on the sub-pixel sizes.

    For example, for a 2x2 sub-pixels in each pixel means the fractional value is 1.0/(2.0^2) = 0.25, if we have the
    following mappings:

    data pixel 0 -> data sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 0
    data pixel 0 -> data sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 0 -> data sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 0 -> data sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 1 -> data sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 1 -> data sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 1 -> data sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 1 -> data sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
    data pixel 2 -> data sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 2
    data pixel 2 -> data sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 2
    data pixel 2 -> data sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 3
    data pixel 2 -> data sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 3

    The mapping matrix (which is still of dimensions [data_pixels, pixelization_pixels]) appears as follows:

    [0.25, 0.75, 0.0, 0.0] [1 sub-pixel maps to pixel 0, 3 map to pixel 1]
    [ 0.0,  1.0, 0.0, 0.0] [All sub-pixels map to pixel 1]
    [ 0.0,  0.0, 0.5, 0.5] [2 sub-pixels map to pixel 2, 2 map to pixel 3]

    For certain pixelizations each data sub-pixel maps to multiple pixelization pixels in a weighted fashion, for
    example a Delaunay pixelization where there are 3 mappings per sub-pixel whose weights are determined via a
    nearest neighbor interpolation scheme.

    In this case, each mapping value is multiplied by this interpolation weight (which are in the array
    `pix_weights_for_sub_slim_index`) when the mapping matrix is constructed.
