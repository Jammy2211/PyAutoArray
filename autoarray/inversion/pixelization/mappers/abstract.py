        """
        To understand a `Mapper` one must be familiar `Mesh` objects and the `mesh` and `pixelization` packages, where
        the four grids grouped in a `MapperGrids` object are explained (`image_plane_data_grid`, `source_plane_data_grid`,
        `image_plane_mesh_grid`,`source_plane_mesh_grid`)

        If you are unfamliar withe above objects, read through the docstrings of the `pixelization`, `mesh` and
        `mapper_grids` packages.

        A `Mapper` determines the mappings between the masked data grid's pixels (`image_plane_data_grid` and
        `source_plane_data_grid`) and the pxelization's pixels (`image_plane_mesh_grid` and `source_plane_mesh_grid`).

        The 1D Indexing of each grid is identical in the `data` and `source` frames (e.g. the transformation does not
        change the indexing, such that `source_plane_data_grid[0]` corresponds to the transformed value
        of `image_plane_data_grid[0]` and so on).

        A mapper therefore only needs to determine the index mappings between the `grid_slim` and `mesh_grid`,
        noting that associations are made by pairing `source_plane_mesh_grid` with `source_plane_data_grid`.

        Mappings are represented in the 2D ndarray `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index`, whereby the index of
        a pixel on the `mesh_grid` maps to the index of a pixel on the `grid_slim` as follows:

        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 0: the data's 1st sub-pixel (index 0) maps to the
          pixelization's 1st pixel (index 0).
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[1, 0] = 3: the data's 2nd sub-pixel (index 1) maps to the
          pixelization's 4th pixel (index 3).
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[2, 0] = 1: the data's 3rd sub-pixel (index 2) maps to the
          pixelization's 2nd pixel (index 1).

        The second dimension of this array (where all three examples above are 0) is used for cases where a
        single pixel on the `grid_slim` maps to multiple pixels on the `mesh_grid`. For example, using a
        `Delaunay` pixelization, where every `grid_slim` pixel maps to three Delaunay pixels (the corners of the
        triangles):

        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 0: the data's 1st sub-pixel (index 0) maps to the
        pixelization's 1st pixel (index 0).
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 1] = 3: the data's 1st sub-pixel (index 0) also maps to the
        pixelization's 2nd pixel (index 3).
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 2] = 5: the data's 1st sub-pixel (index 0) also maps to the
        pixelization's 6th pixel (index 5).

        The mapper allows us to create a mapping matrix, which is a matrix representing the mapping between every
        unmasked data pixel annd the pixels of a pixelization. This matrix is the basis of performing an `Inversion`,
        which reconstructs the data using the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.

            The value corresponding to the reconstructed value of every pixelization pixel (e.g. Delaunay triangle
            vertexes, Voronoi mesh cells).
        shape_native
            The 2D shape in pixels of the interpolated reconstruction, which is always returned using square pixels.
        extent
            The (x0, x1, y0, y1) extent of the grid in scaled coordinates over which the grid is created if it
            is input.

class PixSubWeights:

        """
        Packages the mappings, sizes and weights of every data pixel to pixelization pixels, which are computed
        from associated ``Mapper`` properties..

        The need to store separately the mappings and sizes is so that the `sizes` can be easy iterated over when
        perform calculations for efficiency.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mappings
            The mapping of every data pixel, given its `sub_slim_index`, to its corresponding pixelization mesh
            pixels, given their `pix_indexes` (corresponds to the ``Mapper``
            property ``pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index``)
        sizes
            The number of mappings of every data pixel to pixelization mesh pixels (corresponds to the ``Mapper``
            property ``pix_sizes_for_sub_slim_index``).
        weights
            The interpolation weights of every data pixel's pixelization pixel mapping.
