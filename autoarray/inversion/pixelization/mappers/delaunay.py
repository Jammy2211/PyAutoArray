        """
        To understand a `Mapper` one must be familiar `Mesh` objects and the `mesh` and `pixelization` packages, where
        the four grids grouped in a `MapperGrids` object are explained (`image_plane_data_grid`, `source_plane_data_grid`,
        `image_plane_mesh_grid`,`source_plane_mesh_grid`)

        If you are unfamliar withe above objects, read through the docstrings of the `pixelization`, `mesh` and
        `mapper_grids` packages.

        A `Mapper` determines the mappings between the masked data grid's pixels (`image_plane_data_grid` and
        `source_plane_data_grid`) and the pxelization's pixels (`image_plane_mesh_grid` and `source_plane_mesh_grid`).

        The 1D Indexing of each grid is identical in the `data` and `source` frames (e.g. the transformation does not
        change the indexing, such that `source_plane_data_grid[0]` corresponds to the transformed value
        of `image_plane_data_grid[0]` and so on).

        A mapper therefore only needs to determine the index mappings between the `grid_slim` and `mesh_grid`,
        noting that associations are made by pairing `source_plane_mesh_grid` with `source_plane_data_grid`.

        Mappings are represented in the 2D ndarray `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index`, whereby the index of
        a pixel on the `mesh_grid` maps to the index of a pixel on the `grid_slim` as follows:

        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 0: the data's 1st sub-pixel maps to the pixelization's 1st pixel.
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[1, 0] = 3: the data's 2nd sub-pixel maps to the pixelization's 4th pixel.
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[2, 0] = 1: the data's 3rd sub-pixel maps to the pixelization's 2nd pixel.

        The second dimension of this array (where all three examples above are 0) is used for cases where a
        single pixel on the `grid_slim` maps to multiple pixels on the `mesh_grid`. For example, using a
        `Delaunay` pixelization, where every `grid_slim` pixel maps to three Delaunay pixels (the corners of the
        triangles):

        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 0: the data's 1st sub-pixel maps to the pixelization's 1st pixel.
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 1] = 3: the data's 1st sub-pixel also maps to the pixelization's 4th pixel.
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 2] = 5: the data's 1st sub-pixel also maps to the pixelization's 6th pixel.

        The mapper allows us to create a mapping matrix, which is a matrix representing the mapping between every
        unmasked data pixel annd the pixels of a pixelization. This matrix is the basis of performing an `Inversion`,
        which reconstructs the data using the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mapper_grids
            An object containing the data grid and mesh grid in both the data-frame and source-frame used by the
            mapper to map data-points to linear object parameters.
        regularization
            The regularization scheme which may be applied to this linear object in order to smooth its solution,
            which for a mapper smooths neighboring pixels on the mesh.
        run_time_dict
            A dictionary which contains timing of certain functions calls which is used for profiling.

        """
        Computes the following three quantities describing the mappings between of every sub-pixel in the masked data
        and pixel in the `Delaunay` pixelization.

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index`: the mapping of every data pixel (given its `sub_slim_index`)
        to pixelization pixels (given their `pix_indexes`).

        - `pix_sizes_for_sub_slim_index`: the number of mappings of every data pixel to pixelization pixels.

        - `pix_weights_for_sub_slim_index`: the interpolation weights of every data pixel's pixelization
        pixel mapping

        These are packaged into the class `PixSubWeights` with attributes `mappings`, `sizes` and `weights`.

        The `sub_slim_index` refers to the masked data sub-pixels and `pix_indexes` the pixelization pixel indexes,
        for example:

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 2`: The data's first (index 0) sub-pixel maps to the Rectangular
        pixelization's third (index 2) pixel.

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[2, 0] = 4`: The data's third (index 2) sub-pixel maps to the Rectangular
        pixelization's fifth (index 4) pixel.

        The second dimension of the array `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index`, which is 0 in both examples above, is used
        for cases where a data pixel maps to more than one pixelization pixel.

        For a `Delaunay` pixelization each data pixel maps to 3 Delaunay triangles with interpolation, for example:

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 2`: The data's first (index 0) sub-pixel maps to the Delaunay
        pixelization's third (index 2) pixel.

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 1] = 5`: The data's first (index 0) sub-pixel also maps to the Delaunay
        pixelization's sixth (index 5) pixel.

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 2] = 8`: The data's first (index 0) sub-pixel also maps to the Delaunay
        pixelization's ninth (index 8) pixel.

        The interpolation weights of these multiple mappings are stored in the array `pix_weights_for_sub_slim_index`.

        For the Delaunay pixelization these mappings are calculated using the Scipy spatial library
        (see `mapper_util.pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index_delaunay_from`).
