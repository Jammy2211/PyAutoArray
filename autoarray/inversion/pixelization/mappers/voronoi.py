        """
        To understand a `Mapper` one must be familiar `Mesh` objects and the `mesh` and `pixelization` packages, where
        the four grids grouped in a `MapperGrids` object are explained (`image_plane_data_grid`, `source_plane_data_grid`,
        `image_plane_mesh_grid`,`source_plane_mesh_grid`)

        If you are unfamliar withe above objects, read through the docstrings of the `pixelization`, `mesh` and
        `mapper_grids` packages.

        A `Mapper` determines the mappings between the masked data grid's pixels (`image_plane_data_grid` and
        `source_plane_data_grid`) and the pxelization's pixels (`image_plane_mesh_grid` and `source_plane_mesh_grid`).

        The 1D Indexing of each grid is identical in the `data` and `source` frames (e.g. the transformation does not
        change the indexing, such that `source_plane_data_grid[0]` corresponds to the transformed value
        of `image_plane_data_grid[0]` and so on).

        A mapper therefore only needs to determine the index mappings between the `grid_slim` and `mesh_grid`,
        noting that associations are made by pairing `source_plane_mesh_grid` with `source_plane_data_grid`.

        Mappings are represented in the 2D ndarray `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index`, whereby the index of
        a pixel on the `mesh_grid` maps to the index of a pixel on the `grid_slim` as follows:

        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 0: the data's 1st sub-pixel maps to the mesh's 1st pixel.
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[1, 0] = 3: the data's 2nd sub-pixel maps to the mesh's 4th pixel.
        - pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[2, 0] = 1: the data's 3rd sub-pixel maps to the mesh's 2nd pixel.

        The second dimension of this array (where all three examples above are 0) is used for cases where a
        single pixel on the `grid_slim` maps to multiple pixels on the `mesh_grid`. For example, using a
        `Delaunay` mesh, where every `grid_slim` pixel maps to three Delaunay pixels (the corners of the
        triangles):

        For a `Voronoi` mesh every pixel in the masked data maps to only one Voronoi pixel, thus the second
        dimension of `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index` is always of size 1.

        The mapper allows us to create a mapping matrix, which is a matrix representing the mapping between every
        unmasked data pixel annd the pixels of a mesh. This matrix is the basis of performing an `Inversion`,
        which reconstructs the data using the `source_plane_mesh_grid`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mapper_grids
            An object containing the data grid and mesh grid in both the data-frame and source-frame used by the
            mapper to map data-points to linear object parameters.
        regularization
            The regularization scheme which may be applied to this linear object in order to smooth its solution,
            which for a mapper smooths neighboring pixels on the mesh.
        profiling_dict
            A dictionary which contains timing of certain functions calls which is used for profiling.

        The property `pix_sub_weights` property describes the calculation of the `PixSubWeights` object, which contains
        numpy arrays describing how data-points and mapper pixels map to one another and the weights of these mappings.

        For certain regularization schemes (e.g. `ConstantSplit`, `AdaptiveBrightnessSplit`) regularization uses
        mappings which are split in a cross configuration in order to factor in the derivative of the mapper
        reconstruction.

        This property returns a unique set of `PixSubWeights` used for these regularization schemes which compute
        mappings and weights at each point on the split cross.

        and pixel in the `Voronoi` mesh.

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index`: the mapping of every data pixel (given its `sub_slim_index`)
        to mesh pixels (given their `pix_indexes`).

        - `pix_sizes_for_sub_slim_index`: the number of mappings of every data pixel to mesh pixels.

        pixel mapping

        These are packaged into the class `PixSubWeights` with attributes `mappings`, `sizes` and `weights`.

        The `sub_slim_index` refers to the masked data sub-pixels and `pix_indexes` the mesh pixel indexes,
        for example:

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 2`: The data's first (index 0) sub-pixel maps to the Rectangular
        mesh's third (index 2) pixel.

        mesh's fifth (index 4) pixel.

        The second dimension of the array `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index`, which is 0 in both examples above, is used
        for cases where a data pixel maps to more than one mesh pixel.

        For a this Voronoi mesh a natural neighbor interpolation scheme is used to map each data pixel many
        Voronoi pixels, for example:

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 0] = 2`: The data's first (index 0) sub-pixel maps to the natural
        neighbor of the Voronoi mesh's third (index 2) pixel.

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 1] = 5`: The data's first (index 0) sub-pixel also maps to the natural
        neighbor of the Voronoi mesh's sixth (index 5) pixel.

        - `pix_indexes_for_sub_slim_index[0, 2] = 8`: The data's first (index 0) sub-pixel also maps to the natural
        neighbor of the Voronoi mesh's ninth (index 8) pixel.

        The interpolation weights of these multiple mappings are stored in the array `pix_weights_for_sub_slim_index`.

        The reconstructed values of a mapper (e.g. the `reconstruction` of an `Inversion` may be on an irregular
        pixelization (e.g. a Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi mesh).

        Analysing the reconstruction can therefore be difficult and require specific functionality tailored to using
        this irregular grid.

        This function offers a simple alternative is therefore to interpolate the irregular reconstruction on to a
        regular grid of square pixels. The routine that performs the interpolation is specific to each pixelization
        and contained `Grid2DMesh` object, which are called by this function.

        The output interpolated reconstruction is by default returned on a grid of 401 x 401 square pixels. This
        can be customized by changing the `shape_native` input, and a rectangular grid with rectangular pixels can
        be returned by instead inputting the optional `shape_scaled` tuple.

        Parameters
        ----------
        values
            The value corresponding to the reconstructed value of every pixelization pixel (e.g. Delaunay triangle
            vertexes, Voronoi mesh cells).
        shape_native
            The 2D shape in pixels of the interpolated reconstruction, which is always returned using square pixels.
        extent
            The (x0, x1, y0, y1) extent of the grid in scaled coordinates over which the grid is created if it
