        """
        An abstract dataset, containing the image data, noise-map, PSF and associated quantities for calculations
        like the grid.

        This object is extended with specific dataset types, such as an `Imaging` or `Interferometer` dataset,
        and can be used for fitting data with model data and quantifying the goodness-of-fit.

        The following quantities are abstract and used by any dataset type:

        - `data`: The image data, which shows the signal that is analysed and fitted with a model image.

        - `noise_map`: The RMS standard deviation error in every pixel, which is used to compute the chi-squared value
        and likelihood of a fit.

        The dataset also has a number of (y,x) grids of coordinates associated with it, which map to the centres
        of its image pixels. They are used for performing calculations which map directly to the data and have
        over sampling calculations built in which approximate the 2D line integral of these calculations within a
        pixel. This is explained in more detail in the `GridsDataset` class.

        **Over Sampling**

        If a grid is uniform and the centre of each point on the grid is the centre of a 2D pixel, evaluating
        the value of a function on the grid requires a 2D line integral to compute it precisely. This can be
        computationally expensive and difficult to implement.

        Over sampling is a numerical technique where the function is evaluated on a sub-grid within each grid pixel
        which is higher resolution than the grid itself. This approximates more closely the value of the function
        within a 2D line intergral of the values in the square pixel that the grid is centred.

        For example, in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the light profiles and galaxies are evaluated in order to determine
        how much light falls in each pixel. This uses over sampling and therefore a higher resolution grid than the
        image data to ensure the calculation is accurate.

        This class controls how over sampling is performed for 2 different types of grids:

        - `lp`: A grids of (y,x) coordinates which aligns with the centre of every image pixel of the image data
        and is used to evaluate light profiles for model-fititng.

        - `pixelization`: A grid of (y,x) coordinates which again align with the centre of every image pixel of
        the image data. This grid is used specifically for pixelizations computed via the `inversion` module, which
        can benefit from using different oversampling schemes than the normal grid.

        Different calculations typically benefit from different over sampling, which this class enables
        the customization of.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data
            The array of the image data containing the signal that is fitted (in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the
            recommended units are electrons per second).
        noise_map
            An array describing the RMS standard deviation error in each pixel used for computing quantities like the
            chi-squared in a fit (in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the recommended units are electrons per second).
        noise_covariance_matrix
            A noise-map covariance matrix representing the covariance between noise in every `data` value, which
            can be used via a bespoke fit to account for correlated noise in the data.
        over_sample_size_lp
            The over sampling scheme size, which divides the grid into a sub grid of smaller pixels when computing
            values (e.g. images) from the grid to approximate the 2D line integral of the amount of light that falls
            into each pixel.
        over_sample_size_pixelization
            How over sampling is performed for the grid which is associated with a pixelization, which is therefore
            passed into the calculations performed in the `inversion` module.
