        """
        A dataset is a collection of data structures (e.g. the data, noise-map, PSF), a mask, grid, convolver
        and other utilities that are used for modeling and fitting an image of a strong lens.

        Whilst the image, noise-map, etc. are loaded in 2D, the lens dataset creates reduced 1D arrays of each \
        for lens calculations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_class
            The type of grid used to create the image from the `Galaxy` and `Plane`. The options are `Grid2D` and
            `Grid2DIterate` (see the `Grid2D` documentation for a description of these options).
        grid_pixelization_class
            The type of grid used to create the grid that maps the `Inversion` source pixels to the data's image-pixels.
            The options are `Grid2D` and `Grid2DIterate` (see the `Grid2D` documentation for a
            description of these options).
        sub_size
            If the grid and / or grid_pixelization use a `Grid2D`, this sets the sub-size used by the `Grid2D`.
        fractional_accuracy
            If the grid and / or grid_pixelization use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the fractional accuracy it
            uses when evaluating functions, where the fraction accuracy is the ratio of the values computed using
            two grids at a higher and lower sub-grid size.
        relative_accuracy
            If the grid and / or grid_pixelization use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the relative accuracy it
            uses when evaluating functions, where the relative accuracy is the absolute difference of the values
            computed using two grids at a higher and lower sub-grid size.
        sub_steps : [int]
            If the grid and / or grid_pixelization use a `Grid2DIterate`, this sets the steps the sub-size is increased by
            to meet the fractional accuracy when evaluating functions.
