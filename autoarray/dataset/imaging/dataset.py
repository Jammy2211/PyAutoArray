        """
        An imaging dataset, containing the image data, noise-map, PSF and associated quantities
        for calculations like the grid.

        This object is the input to the `FitImaging` object, which fits the dataset with a model image and quantifies
        the goodness-of-fit via a residual map, likelihood, chi-squared and other quantities.

        The following quantities of the imaging data are available and used for the following tasks:

        - `data`: The image data, which shows the signal that is analysed and fitted with a model image.

        - `noise_map`: The RMS standard deviation error in every pixel, which is used to compute the chi-squared value
        and likelihood of a fit.

        - `psf`: The Point Spread Function of the data, used to perform 2D convolution on images to produce a model
        image which is compared to the data.

        The dataset also has a number of (y,x) grids of coordinates associated with it, which map to the centres
        of its image pixels. They are used for performing calculations which map directly to the data and have
        over sampling calculations built in which approximate the 2D line integral of these calculations within a
        pixel. This is explained in more detail in the `GridsDataset` class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data
            The array of the image data containing the signal that is fitted (in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the
            recommended units are electrons per second).
        noise_map
            An array describing the RMS standard deviation error in each pixel used for computing quantities like the
            chi-squared in a fit (in PyAutoGalaxy and PyAutoLens the recommended units are electrons per second).
        psf
            The Point Spread Function kernel of the image which accounts for diffraction due to the telescope optics
            via 2D convolution.
        noise_covariance_matrix
            A noise-map covariance matrix representing the covariance between noise in every `data` value, which
            can be used via a bespoke fit to account for correlated noise in the data.
        over_sample_size_lp
            The over sampling scheme size, which divides the grid into a sub grid of smaller pixels when computing
            values (e.g. images) from the grid to approximate the 2D line integral of the amount of light that falls
            into each pixel.
        over_sample_size_pixelization
            How over sampling is performed for the grid which is associated with a pixelization, which is therefore
            passed into the calculations performed in the `inversion` module.
        pad_for_psf
            The PSF convolution may extend beyond the edges of the image mask, which can lead to edge effects in the
            convolved image. If `True`, the image and noise-map are padded to ensure the PSF convolution does not
            extend beyond the edge of the image.
        use_normalized_psf
            If `True`, the PSF kernel values are rescaled such that they sum to 1.0. This can be important for ensuring
            the PSF kernel does not change the overall normalization of the image when it is convolved with it.
        check_noise_map
            If True, the noise-map is checked to ensure all values are above zero.

        Load an imaging dataset from multiple .fits file.

        For each attribute of the imaging data (e.g. `data`, `noise_map`, `pre_cti_data`) the path to
        the .fits and the `hdu` containing the data can be specified.

        The `noise_map` assumes the noise value in each `data` value are independent, where these values are the
        the RMS standard deviation error in each pixel.

        A `noise_covariance_matrix` can be input instead, which represents the covariance between noise values in
        the data and can be used to fit the data accounting for correlations (the `noise_map` is the diagonal values
        of this matrix).

        If the dataset has a mask associated with it (e.g. in a `mask.fits` file) the file must be loaded separately
        via the `Mask2D` object and applied to the imaging after loading via fits using the `from_fits` method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixel_scales
            The (y,x) arcsecond-to-pixel units conversion factor of every pixel. If this is input as a `float`,

            The path to the data .fits file containing the image data (e.g. '/path/to/image.fits').
        data_hdu
            The hdu the image data is contained in the .fits file specified by `data_path`.
        psf_path
            The path to the psf .fits file containing the psf (e.g. '/path/to/psf.fits').
        psf_hdu
            The hdu the psf is contained in the .fits file specified by `psf_path`.
        noise_map_path
            The path to the noise_map .fits file containing the noise_map (e.g. '/path/to/noise_map.fits').
        noise_map_hdu
            The hdu the noise map is contained in the .fits file specified by `noise_map_path`.
        noise_covariance_matrix
            A noise-map covariance matrix representing the covariance between noise in every `data` value.
        check_noise_map
            If True, the noise-map is checked to ensure all values are above zero.
        over_sample_size_lp
            The over sampling scheme size, which divides the grid into a sub grid of smaller pixels when computing
            values (e.g. images) from the grid to approximate the 2D line integral of the amount of light that falls

        the masked data values are set to zero. This can be disabled by setting `should_zero_data=False`.

        Two forms of scaling are supported depending on whether the `signal_to_noise_value` is input:

        - `noise_value`: The noise-map values in the masked region are set to this value, typically a very large value,
        such that they are never included in the likelihood calculation.

        - `signal_to_noise_value`: The noise-map values in the masked region are set to values such that they give
        this signal-to-noise ratio. This overwrites the `noise_value` parameter.

        For certain modeling tasks, the mask defines regions of the data that are used to calculate the likelihood.
        For example, all data points in a mask may be used to create a pixel-grid, which is used in the likelihood.
        When data points are moved via `apply_mask`, they would be omitted from this grid entirely, which would
        lead to an incorrect likelihood calculation. Noise scaling retains these data points in the likelihood
        calculation, but ensures they do not contribute to the fit.

        This function can only be applied before actual masking.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mask
            The 2D mask that is applied to the image and noise-map, to scale the noise-map values to large values.
        noise_value
            The value that the noise-map values are set to in the masked region where noise scaling is applied.
        signal_to_noise_value
            The noise-map values are instead set to values such that they give this signal-to-noise_maps ratio.
            This overwrites the noise_value parameter.
        should_zero_data
            If True, the data values in the masked region are set to zero.

        """
        Apply new over sampling objects to the grid and grid pixelization of the dataset.

        This method is used to change the over sampling of the grid and grid pixelization, for example when the
        user wishes to perform over sampling with a higher sub grid size or with an iterative over sampling strategy.

        The `grid` and grids.pixelization` are cached properties which after use are stored in memory for efficiency.
        This function resets the cached properties so that the new over sampling is used in the grid and grid
        pixelization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        over_sample_size_lp
            The over sampling scheme size, which divides the grid into a sub grid of smaller pixels when computing
            values (e.g. images) from the grid to approximate the 2D line integral of the amount of light that falls
            into each pixel.
        over_sample_size_pixelization
            How over sampling is performed for the grid which is associated with a pixelization, which is therefore
            passed into the calculations performed in the `inversion` module.
