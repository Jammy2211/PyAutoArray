        """
        An interferometer dataset, containing the visibilities data, noise-map, real-space msk, Fourier transformer and
        associated quantities for calculations like the grid.

        This object is the input to the `FitInterferometer` object, which fits the dataset with model visibilities
        and quantifies the goodness-of-fit via a residual map, likelihood, chi-squared and other quantities.

        The following quantities of the interferometer data are available and used for the following tasks:

        - `data`: The visibilities data, which shows the signal that is analysed and fitted with model visibilities.

        - `noise_map`: The RMS standard deviation error in every visibility, which is used to compute the chi-squared
        value and likelihood of a fit.

        - `uv_wavelengths`: The baselines of the interferometer which are used to Fourier transform a real space
        image to the uv-plane.

        `real_space_mask`: Defines in real space where the signal is present. This mask is used to transform images to
        Fourier space via the Fourier transform. The grids contained in the settings are aligned with this mask.

        The dataset also has a number of (y,x) grids of coordinates associated with it, which map to the centres
        of its image pixels. They are used for performing calculations which map directly to the data and have
        over sampling calculations built in which approximate the 2D line integral of these calculations within a
        pixel. This is explained in more detail in the `GridsDataset` class.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data
            The array of the visibilities data containing the signal that is fitted.
        noise_map
            An array describing the RMS standard deviation error in each visibility used for computing quantities like the
            chi-squared in a fit.
        uv_wavelengths
            The baselines of the interferometer which are used to Fourier transform a real space
            image to the uv-plane.
        real_space_mask
            Defines in real space where the signal is present. This mask is used to transform images to
            Fourier space via the Fourier transform. The grids contained in the settings are aligned with this mask.
        noise_covariance_matrix
            A noise-map covariance matrix representing the covariance between noise in every `data` value, which
            can be used via a bespoke fit to account for correlated noise in the data.
        transformer_class
            The class of the Fourier Transform which maps images from real space to Fourier space visibilities and
            the uv-plane.
        sparse_operator
            A precomputed `InterferometerSparseOperator` containing the NUFFT precision matrix for efficient
            pixelized source reconstruction. This is computed via `apply_sparse_operator()` and can be passed
            here directly to avoid recomputing it (e.g. when loading a cached result from disk).
        raise_error_dft_visibilities_limit
            If `True`, an exception is raised if the dataset has more than 10,000 visibilities and
            `transformer_class=TransformerDFT`. The DFT is too slow for large datasets and `TransformerNUFFT`
            should be used instead. Set to `False` to suppress this check.

        coordinates) are each loaded from separate .fits files. A real-space mask defining the sky
        region used for Fourier transforms must be supplied separately.

        The visibilities are assumed to be stored as a 2D array of shape (total_visibilities, 2) where
        column 0 is the real component and column 1 is the imaginary component. The noise map has the
        same shape. The uv_wavelengths are a 2D array of shape (total_visibilities, 2) with columns
        corresponding to the (u, v) baseline coordinates in units of wavelengths.

        ----------

        uv_wavelengths_path
            The path to the .fits file containing the (u, v) baseline coordinates in units of
            wavelengths (e.g. '/path/to/uv_wavelengths.fits').
        real_space_mask
            A `Mask2D` defining the real-space region of the sky that contains signal. This mask
            determines the pixel grid used by the Fourier transformer and the coordinate grids
            associated with the dataset.
        visibilities_hdu
            The HDU index in the visibilities .fits file from which data is loaded.
        noise_map_hdu
            The HDU index in the noise map .fits file from which data is loaded.
        uv_wavelengths_hdu
            The HDU index in the uv_wavelengths .fits file from which data is loaded.
        transformer_class
            The class of the Fourier Transform which maps images from real space to Fourier space
            visibilities. Defaults to `TransformerNUFFT` for efficiency with large datasets.

        Precompute the NUFFT precision operator for efficient pixelized source reconstruction.

        The sparse linear algebra formalism precomputes the Fourier Transform response matrix for all
        visibility baselines, enabling fast repeated evaluation during model fitting. This avoids
        recomputing the full NUFFT on every likelihood call.

        The resulting `InterferometerSparseOperator` is stored on the returned `Interferometer` dataset
        and is used automatically by `FitInterferometer` when performing pixelized reconstructions via
        the inversion module.

        Computing the NUFFT precision matrix from scratch can be very slow (runtime scales with both
        the number of visibilities and the real-space mask resolution — potentially hours for large
        datasets). The result can be cached to disk and reloaded to avoid recomputation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nufft_precision_operator
            An already computed NUFFT precision matrix for this dataset (e.g. loaded from disk via
            `np.load`) to avoid an expensive recomputation. If `None` it is computed from scratch
            by calling `psf_precision_operator_from()`.
        batch_size
            The number of real-space pixels processed per batch when building the sparse operator.
            Reducing this lowers peak memory usage at the cost of speed.
        chunk_k
            The number of visibilities processed per chunk when computing the NUFFT precision matrix
            inside `psf_precision_operator_from()`. Reducing this lowers peak memory usage.
        show_progress
            If `True`, a progress bar is displayed while computing the NUFFT precision matrix.
        show_memory
            If `True`, memory usage statistics are printed while computing the NUFFT precision matrix.
        use_jax
