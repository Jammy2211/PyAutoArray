        """
        Simulates observations of `Interferometer` data, including transforming a real-space image to
        complex-valued visibilities in Fourier space and optionally adding complex Gaussian noise.

        The simulation of an `Interferometer` dataset uses the following steps:

        1) Receive as input a real-space image (e.g. a model galaxy or lens system) and a set of UV-plane
           baselines (uv_wavelengths) describing the interferometer configuration.
        2) Fourier transform the real-space image to the UV-plane using the configured transformer class
           (DFT or NUFFT) to produce model visibilities.
        3) Optionally add complex Gaussian noise to the visibilities, with the noise level controlled by
           `noise_sigma`. The noise is added independently to the real and imaginary parts.
        4) Create a constant noise map with value `noise_sigma` for every visibility. If noise is not
           added (`noise_sigma=None`), the noise map is filled with `noise_if_add_noise_false` instead.

        The returned `Interferometer` dataset contains the simulated visibilities, noise map,
        uv_wavelengths and real-space mask, and can be used directly with `FitInterferometer`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        uv_wavelengths
            The (u, v) baseline coordinates of the interferometer in units of wavelengths. This is a
            2D array of shape (total_visibilities, 2) where each row is a (u, v) baseline pair. These
            define the Fourier-space sampling of the observation.
        exposure_time
            The exposure time of the simulated interferometer observation in seconds.
        transformer_class
            The class used to perform the Fourier transform between real space and the UV-plane. The
            default `TransformerDFT` is suitable for small datasets (fewer than ~10,000 visibilities).
            For larger datasets use `TransformerNUFFT` for efficiency.
        noise_sigma
            The standard deviation of the complex Gaussian noise added to each visibility. Noise is
            added independently to the real and imaginary components. If `None`, no noise is added to
            the visibilities but a noise map is still created using `noise_if_add_noise_false`.
        noise_if_add_noise_false
            The noise value assigned to every visibility in the noise map when `noise_sigma=None`
            (i.e. when no noise is added to the data). This gives the noise map a non-zero value
            so that downstream fits remain well-defined.
        noise_seed
            The random seed used for noise generation. A value of -1 uses a different random seed
            on every run, producing different noise realisations each time.

    def via_image_from(self, image):
        """
        Simulate an `Interferometer` dataset from an input real-space image.

        The steps of the simulation process are described in the `SimulatorInterferometer` `__init__`
        docstring. In brief: the image is Fourier transformed to visibilities using the configured
        transformer class and the uv_wavelengths baselines, then complex Gaussian noise is optionally
        added and a constant noise map is created.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image
            The 2D real-space image from which the interferometer dataset is simulated (e.g. the
            surface brightness of a galaxy or lens system). Must be an `Array2D` with an associated
            mask that defines the real-space region used for the Fourier transform.

        -------
        Interferometer
            The simulated interferometer dataset containing visibilities, noise map, uv_wavelengths
            and the real-space mask derived from the input image.
