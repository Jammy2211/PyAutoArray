        """
        Contains grids of (y,x) Cartesian coordinates at the centre of every pixel in the dataset's image and
        mask, which are used for performing calculations on the datas.

        The following grids are contained:

        - `lp`: A grids of (y,x) coordinates which aligns with the centre of every image pixel of the image data,
        which is used for most normal calculations (e.g. evaluating the amount of light that falls in an pixel
        from a light profile).

        - `pixelization`: A grid of (y,x) coordinates which again align with the centre of every image pixel of
        the image data. This grid is used specifically for pixelizations computed via the `inversion` module, which
        can benefit from using different oversampling schemes than the normal grid.

        - `blurring`: A grid of (y,x) coordinates which are used to compute the blurring of the image data. This image
        contains the light of all pixels that are masked, but are close enough to the unmasked pixels that their light
        will be convolved into the unmasked pixels by the PSF.

        Every grid has its own `over_sampling` class which defines how over sampling is performed for these grids and
        is described in the corresponding `over_sampling.py` module.

        This is used in the project PyAutoGalaxy to load imaging data of a galaxy and fit it with galaxy light profiles.
        It is used in PyAutoLens to load imaging data of a strong lens and fit it with a lens model.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mask
            The 2D mask defining which pixels are included in the dataset. All grids are constructed
            to align with the centres of the unmasked pixels in this mask.
        over_sample_size_lp
            The over sampling scheme size, which divides the grid into a sub grid of smaller pixels when computing
            values (e.g. images) from the grid to approximate the 2D line integral of the amount of light that falls
            into each pixel.
        over_sample_size_pixelization
            How over sampling is performed for the grid which is associated with a pixelization, which is therefore
            passed into the calculations performed in the `inversion` module.
        psf
            The Point Spread Function kernel of the image which accounts for diffraction due to the telescope optics
            via 2D convolution. Required to compute the blurring grid; if `None` the blurring grid
            is not constructed.
