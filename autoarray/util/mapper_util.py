    """
    Returns the mappings between a set of slimmed sub-grid pixels and pixelization pixels, using information on
    how the pixels hosting each sub-pixel map to their closest pixelization pixel on the slim grid in the data-plane
    and the pixelization's pixel centres.

    To determine the complete set of slim sub-pixel to pixelization pixel mappings, we must pair every sub-pixel to
    its nearest pixel. Using a full nearest neighbor search to do this is slow, thus the pixel neighbors (derived via
    the Voronoi grid) are used to localize each nearest neighbor search by using a graph search.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : Grid2D
        The grid of (y,x) scaled coordinates at the centre of every unmasked pixel, which has been traced to
        to an irgrid via lens.
    nearest_pixelization_index_for_slim_index : np.ndarray
        A 1D array that maps every slimmed data-plane pixel to its nearest pixelization pixel.
    slim_index_for_sub_slim_index : np.ndarray
        The mappings between the data slimmed sub-pixels and their regular pixels.
    pixelization_grid : np.ndarray
        The (y,x) centre of every Voronoi pixel in arc-seconds.
    pixel_neighbors : np.ndarray
        An array of length (voronoi_pixels) which provides the index of all neighbors of every pixel in
        the Voronoi grid (entries of -1 correspond to no neighbor).
    pixel_neighbors_size : np.ndarray
        An array of length (voronoi_pixels) which gives the number of neighbors of every pixel in the
        Voronoi grid.

    """
    Returns the (hyper) signal in each pixel, where the signal is the sum of its mapped data values.
    These pixel-signals are used to compute the effective regularization weight of each pixel.

    The pixel signals are computed as follows:

    1) Divide by the number of mappe data points in the pixel, to ensure all pixels have the same
    'relative' signal (i.e. a pixel with 10 pixels doesn't have x2 the signal of one with 5).

    2) Divided by the maximum pixel-signal, so that all signals vary between 0 and 1. This ensures that the
    regularization weights are defined identically for any data quantity or signal-to-noise_map ratio.

    3) Raised to the power of the hyper-parameter *signal_scale*, so the method can control the relative
    contribution regularization in different regions of pixelization.

    Parameters
    -----------
    pixels : int
        The total number of pixels in the pixelization the regularization scheme is applied to.
    signal_scale : float
        A factor which controls how rapidly the smoothness of regularization varies from high signal regions to
        low signal regions.

        A 1D array util every pixel on the grid to a pixel on the pixelization.
