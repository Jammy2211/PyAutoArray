def sub_line_1d_slim_from(

) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    For a 1D sub line and mask, map the values of all unmasked pixels to its slimmed 1D sub-line.

    A sub-line is an array whose native dimensions correspond to the normal line (without masking) multiplied by the
    sub_size. For example if a native line is shape [total_unmasked_x_pixels] and the ``sub_size=2``, the sub_line is
    shape [total_unmasked_x_pixels*sub_size].

    The pixel coordinate origin is at the left of the 1D array and goes right, with sub-pixels then going right in
    each pixel. For example, for an array of shape (3,3) and a sub-grid size of 2 where all pixels are unmasked:

    - pixel[0] of the native 1D array will correspond to index 0 of the slim array (which is the first sub-pixel in
    the line).
    - pixel[1] of the native 1D array will correspond to index 1 of the slim array (which is the second sub-pixel in
    the line).

    If the native lined is masked and the third pixel is masked (e.g. its mask_1d entry is `True`) then:

    - pixels [0], [1], [2] and [3] of the native 1D array will correspond to indexes 0, 1, 2, 3 of the slim array.
    - pixels [4] and [5] of the native 1D array do not map to the slim array (these sub-pixels are masked).
    - pixel [6], [7], etc. of the native 1D array will correspond to indexes 4, 5, etc. of the slim array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sub_line_1d_native : np.ndarray
        A 1D array of values on the dimensions of the native sub-line.
    mask_1d : np.ndarray
        A 1D array of bools, where `False` values mean unmasked and are included in the mapping.
    sub_size : int
        The sub-grid size of the sub-line.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The slimmed 1D sub-line of values mapped from the native 1d sub-line with
        dimensions [total_unmasked_x_pixels*sub_size].
