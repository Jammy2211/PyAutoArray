"""
    This file contains functions use the Bro & Jong (1997) algorithm to solve the non-negative least
        square problem. The `fnnls and fix_constraint` is orginally copied from 
        "https://github.com/jvendrow/fnnls".
    For our purpose in PyAutoArray, we create `fnnls_modefied` to take ZTZ and ZTx as inputs directly.
    Furthermore, we add two functions `fnnls_Cholesky and fix_constraint_Cholesky` to realize a scheme
        that solves the lstsq problem in the algorithm by Cholesky factorisation. For ~ 1000 free 
        parameters, we see a speed up by 2 times and should be more for more parameters.
    We have also noticed that by setting the P_initial to be `sla.solve(ZTZ, ZTx, assume_a='pos') > 0`
        will speed up our task (~ 1000 free parameters) by ~ 3 times as it significantly reduces the
        iteration time.
