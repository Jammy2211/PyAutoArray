        Class to fit a masked imaging dataset.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The masked dataset that is fitted.
        dataset_model
            Attributes which allow for parts of a dataset to be treated as a model (e.g. the background sky level).
        use_mask_in_fit
            If `True`, masked data points are omitted from the fit. If `False` they are not (in most use cases the
            `dataset` will have been processed to remove masked points, for example the `slim` representation).

        Attributes
        -----------
        residual_map
            The residual-map of the fit (data - model_data).
        chi_squared_map
            The chi-squared-map of the fit ((data - model_data) / noise_maps ) **2.0
        chi_squared
            The overall chi-squared of the model's fit to the dataset, summed over every data point.
        reduced_chi_squared
            The reduced chi-squared of the model's fit to simulate (chi_squared / number of data points), summed over \
            every data point.
        noise_normalization
            The overall normalization term of the noise_map, summed over every data point.
        log_likelihood
            The overall log likelihood of the model's fit to the dataset, summed over every data point.
