    """
    Rotates an input array such that its read-out electronics corner (``roe_corner``) are positioned at the
    'bottom-left' (e.g. [1,0]) of the ndarray data structure.

    This is used to homogenize arrays to a common orientation, especially for the project **PyAutoCTI**
    which performs clocking for Charge Transfer Inefficiency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array
        The array which is rotated.
    roe_corner
        The corner of the array at which the read-out electronics are located (e.g. (1, 1) is the bottom-right corner).
        The rotation is based on this such that the read-out electronics are in the bottom-left (e.g. (1, 0)).

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The rotated array where the read out electronics are at the bottom left corner, (1, 0).

    When we extract an array, we also update the extracted array's regions by mapping each region from their
    coordinates on the original array (which has a shape_native) to the extracted array (which is a 2D section
    on this array).

    This function compares the 1D coordinates of a regions original coordinates on a array to the 1D coordinates of the
    extracted array, determining where the original region lies on the extracted array.

    For example, for a 1D array with shape 8 we may have a region whose 1D coordinates span x0o=2 -> x1o=6. From the
    original 1D array we then extract the region x0e=5 -> x1e = 7. This looks as follows:

                                eeeeeeeee
                                5        7      e = extracted region
          oooooooooooooooooooooooooo            o = original region
         2                          6           - = original array (which has shape = 8

     0                                    8

     In the above example this function will recognise that the extracted region will contain a small section of the
     original region and for the extracted region give it coordinates (0, 1). This function covers all possible
     ways the original region and extracted array could over lap.

    If the extraction completely the region a None is returned.
